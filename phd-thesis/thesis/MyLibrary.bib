  abstract = {System integration is an essential part of the engineering design process. The Ares I Upper Stage (US) is a complex system which is made up of thousands of components assembled into subsystems including a J2-X engine, liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LO2) tanks, avionics, thrust vector control, motors, etc. System integration is the task of connecting together all of the subsystems into one large system. To ensure that all the components will "fit together" as well as safety and, quality, integration analysis is required. Integration analysis verifies that, as an integrated system, the system will behave as designed. Models that represent the actual subsystems are built for more comprehensive analysis. Matlab has been an instrument widely use by engineers to construct mathematical models of systems. Simulink, one of the tools offered by Matlab, provides multi-domain graphical environment to simulate and design time-varying systems. Simulink is a powerful tool to analyze the dynamic behavior of systems over time. Furthermore, Simscape, a tool provided by Simulink, allows users to model physical (such as mechanical, thermal and hydraulic) systems using physical networks. Using Simscape, a model representing an inflow of gas to a pressurized tank was created where the temperature and pressure of the tank are measured over time to show the behavior of the gas. By further incorporation of Simscape into model building, the full potential of this software can be discovered and it hopefully can become a more utilized tool.},

  title = {Computational {{Fluid Dynamics}} of Dispersed Two-Phase Flows at High Phase Fractions},
  abstract = {This study describes the development and validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) methodology for the simulation of dispersed two-phase 
ows.
A two-
uid (Euler-Euler) methodology previously developed at Imperial College
is adapted to high phase fractions. It employs averaged mass and momentum conservation
equations to describe the time-dependent motion of both phases and, due to the
averaging process, requires additional models for the inter-phase momentum transfer
and turbulence for closure. The continuous phase turbulence is represented using a
two-equation k $\dottedsquare\dottedsquare$ "$\dottedsquare\dottedsquare$turbulence model which contains additional terms to account for
the e$\dottedsquare$ects of the dispersed on the continuous phase turbulence. The Reynolds stresses
of the dispersed phase are calculated by relating them to those of the continuous phase
through a turbulence response function.
The inter-phase momentum transfer is determined from the instantaneous forces
acting on the dispersed phase, comprising drag, lift and virtual mass. These forces are
phase fraction dependent and in this work revised modelling is put forward in order to
capture the phase fraction dependency of drag and lift. Furthermore, a correlation for
the e$\dottedsquare$ect of the phase fraction on the turbulence response function is proposed. The
revised modelling is based on an extensive survey of the existing literature.
The conservation equations are discretised using the $\dottedsquare$nite-volume method and
solved in a solution procedure, which is loosely based on the PISO algorithm, adapted
to the solution of the two-
uid model. Special techniques are employed to ensure the
stability of the procedure when the phase fraction is high or changing rapidely.
Finally, assessment of the methodology is made with reference to experimental
data for gas-liquid bubbly 
ow in a sudden enlargement of a circular pipe and in a
plane mixing layer.
Additionally, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed using an
interface-capturing methodology in order to gain insight into the dynamics of free
rising bubbles, with a view towards use in the longer term as an aid in the development
of inter-phase momentum transfer models for the two-
uid methodology. The
direct numerical simulation employs the mass and momentum conservation equations
in their unaveraged form and the topology of the interface between the two phases is
determined as part of the solution. A novel solution procedure, similar to that used
for the two-
uid model, is used for the interface-capturing methodology, which allows
calculation of air bubbles in water. Two situations are investigated: bubbles rising in
a stagnant liquid and in a shear 
ow. Again, experimental data are used to verify the
computational results.},

  title = {Modeling and {{Simulation}} of {{Engineering Systems}}},
  abstract = {For engineering systems, the modeling approaches presented in the previous chapters can of course
be used. For a normal system, if the mathematical models of the engineering systems are established,
Simulink models can easily be constructed since low-level Simulink blocks can be used to model
systems with arbitrary complexity into simulation models. For complicated engineering systems,
the low-level modeling techniques sometimes become very complicated, if not impossible. With
solid knowledge and theoretical background in the field, the user may be able to generate the model
needed. If some part of the whole simulation system is not well handled, this may cause inaccuracy
or even significant errors in the results. Meanwhile, since the low-level models are too complicated
in structure, the model constructed may be too complicated to diagnose or to maintain. Thus for
many practical engineering systems, low-level modeling is not a good choice.
The multi-domain physical modeling strategy advocated and implemented in Simulink provides a
new methodology for modeling and simulation of engineering and non-engineering systems. Many
well-established and specialized blocksets in various disciplines have been developed. Some of the
blocksets have been developed in the Simscape framework, and a Simscape language is also provided.
The main idea of the multi-domain physical modeling is that a series of blocks or components are
masked, which allows the user to assemble Simulink models with these building blocks just as if they
were assembling the actual hardware systems. The physical model can be constructed in Simulink
in this way, and the mathematical model can be automatically generated with the physical model,
such that the facilities in Simulink can be used to simulate and analyze the constructed system.
Since the model is established using building block methods, it is very easy to examine and validate
the model. Also, since the well-established blocks can be used directly to assemble the system
models, solid background knowledge is no longer necessary. For instance, an electrical engineer can
easily establish a mechanical model without reading too much material on mechanical engineering,
and the model constructed is much more reliable than one they could establish themselves using
low-level modeling methods. In this way, interdisciplinary modeling is possible. More importantly,
the model can be established in the same Simulink framework. From the simulation point of view,
this modeling strategy has its own advantages.
In Section 7 .1, the concept of multi-domain physical modeling is presented, and an introduction to
the Simscape blockset is also given. In Section 7.2, electrical system modeling with SimPowerSystems
and other blocksets is addressed. In Sections 7 . 3 \textasciitilde{} 7 .5, modeling and simulation of electronic systems, motor drive systems and mechanical systems are presented and a lot of examples are
provided.},

  title = {On Pragmatism in Industrial Modeling},
  abstract = {Many natural or industrial processes are of extreme complexity, and where the time- and length scales range from atomistic level to years and kilometers. Often the processes or phenomena consist of multiple sub processes in which each comprises its own length and time scales. An example can be production of aluminum by the Hall-Heroult process, where process streams or raw materials, flow dynamics and segregation in silos, with time varying quality, the feeding and operational routines, the reduction cells with numerous sub processes, and the tapping process, all make up a complete process. To optimize such type of production with respect to economic and environmental parameters we will have to develop models which can give the overall picture and at the same time be accurate enough to support the optimization process. As there are many dynamic aspects of an industrial production, the ultimate need will be a model which can compute much faster than real time and which can be used to support operation and to develop new processes. In this paper we discuss how this type of pragmatic industrial models can be developed. We will identify and discuss the tools needed for such an analyses, including the analyses process itself and the frameworks needed for such analyses. Key elements in our pragmatic modeling concepts are human knowledge, including capabilities to understand complex phenomena and how these can be modeled simplified but "good enough", systematic use of existing information, systematic analyses of what information (model results) is needed and at with which accuracy and speed the results must be produced. Another key element is the selection and collection of experiment data and the exploitation of data, organized and made accessible in the optimal manner to support the predictiveness of the pragmatism based model. The organization of all types of data is organized by a "bridge" (modeling middleware) between complex scientific (aspect/phenomenon oriented) physical models, simplified models and process data. We believe that this type of pragmatic industrial models will enable a step change in both operation, operator training and process optimization, as well as design of new processes. Finally, in a case study, we apply our pragmatic modeling concept to the aluminum production process and discuss the implications of our proposed concept.},

This is done both as part of the treatment of the fundamentals, where appropriate, and also in the separate sections devoted to specific kinds of industries. Throughout, the treatment is integrated, with the principles of colloid and interface science common to each dispersion type presented for each major physical property class, followed by separate treatments of features unique to emulsions, foams, or suspensions.The first half of the book introduces the fundamental principles, introducing readers to suspension formation and stability, characterization, and flow properties, emphasizing practical aspects throughout. The following chapters discuss a wide range of industrial applications and examples, serving to emphasize the different methodologies that have been successfully applied.Overall, the book shows how to approach making emulsions, foams, and suspensions with different useful properties, how to propagate them, and how to prevent their formation or destabilize them if necessary.The author assumes no prior knowledge of colloid chemistry and, with its glossary of key terms, complete cross-referencing and indexing, this is a must-have for graduate and professional scientists and engineers who may encounter or use emulsions, foams, or suspensions, or combinations thereof, whether in process design, industrial production, or in related R\&D fields.},

  title = {Design and {{Implementation}} of {{Object}}-{{Oriented Model Libraries}} Using {{Modelica}}},
  abstract = {This thesis describes basic models for thermo-fluid systems and the implementation of the models using a flexible object-oriented structure in the ThermoFluid library. Model libraries provide an excellent way to package engineering knowledge of systems to be reused by non-experts. Many commercial simulation packages provide good model libraries, but they are usually domain specific and closed. Modelica(TM) is an open standard of an object-oriented modeling language for heterogeneous, multi-domain dynamic systems. Modelica combines the expressive power of equation based modeling with advanced object-oriented structuring features. A unique feature of Modelica are class parameters which allow a high-level parameterization of physical phenomena. The models are based on first principles. Control volumes contain the thermodynamic balance equations in lumped or one-dimensional discretized form. The library is built to be flexible: fluid property models in the control volume can be exchanged, single- or multi-component fluids are supported and the momentum balance submodel can be static or dynamic. Chemical reactions can be added to the model separately from other phenomena. Thermodynamic Jacobians are used to transform the dynamic equations into an efficient form. Low order moving boundary models for two phase flows are another result of the thesis. They make use of a novel approach for approximating the mean void fraction in the two phase region. The experiences from designing an object-oriented, reusable model library are summarized using design patterns. Design patterns are an attempt to describe "good practice'' in modeling in a semi-formal way. The library has been used successfully for a broad range of industrial applications, among others modeling of micro gas turbine systems, carbon-dioxide based refrigeration systems, fuel cells, power plants and steam networks. The applications are briefly described in the thesis.},

Now in its second edition, it has been entirely updated and substantially extended to reflect advances in technology, research into rotor aerodynamics and the structural response of the wind turbine structure. Topics covered include increasing mass flow through the turbine, performance at low and high wind speeds, assessment of the extreme conditions under which the turbine will perform and the theory for calculating the lifetime of the turbine. The classical Blade Element Momentum method is also covered, as are eigenmodes and the dynamic behavior of a turbine. The new material includes a description of the effects of the dynamics and how this can be modeled in an aeroelastic code, which is widely used in the design and verification of modern wind turbines. Further, the description of how to calculate the vibration of the whole construction as well as the time varying loads has been substantially updated. This is the essential reference for both engineering students and others with a professional or academic interest in the physics and technologies behind horizontal axis wind turbines.},

  title = {On the Wave Structure of Two-Phase Flow Models},
  volume = {67},
  abstract = {We explore the relationship between two common two-phase flow models, usually denoted as the two-fluid and drift-flux models. They differ in their mathematical description of momentum transfer between the phases. In this paper we provide a framework in which these two model formulations are unified. The drift-flux model employs a mixture momentum equation and treats interphasic momentum exchange indirectly through the slip relation, which gives the relative velocity between the phases as a function of the flow parameters. This closure law is in general highly complex, which makes it difficult to analyze the model algebraically. To facilitate the analysis, we express the quasi-linear formulation of the drift-flux model as a function of three parameters: the derivatives of the slip with respect to the vector of unknown variables. The wave structure of this model is investigated using a perturbation technique. Then we rewrite the drift-flux model with a general slip relation such that it is expressed in terms of the canonical two-fluid form. That is, we replace the mixture momentum equation and the slip relation with equivalent evolution equations for the momentums of each phase. We obtain a mathematically equivalent formulation in terms of a two-fluid model and by this bridge some of the gap between the drift-flux model and the two-fluid model. Finally, the effect of the various exchange terms on the wave structure of the two-fluid model is investigated.},

In this work we'll determine the effects of dimensional parameters variances on a mechatronic system performance.

  abstract = {This paper introduces a graphical, computer aided modelling methodology that is particularly suited for the concurrent design of multidisciplinary systems, viz. of engineering systems with mechanical, electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic components, including interactions of physical effects from various energy domains. Following the introduction, bond graph modelling of multibody systems, as an example of an advanced topic, is briefly addressed in order to demonstrate the potential of this powerful approach to modelling multidisciplinary systems. It is shown how models of multibody systems including flexible bodies can be built in a systematic manner. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In contrast, bond graph modelling starts from the intuitive and physical approach that a dynamic system is composed of subsystems, components, or basic elements that interact by exchanging energy. From this basic description, a first (preliminary) definition of a bond graph can be derived and some important conclusions can be drawn which show that bond graph modelling fundamentally differs from block diagram modelling.},

Starting with the definition of a non- Newtonian fluid, different types of non-Newtonian characteristics are briefly de- scribed. Representative examples of materials (foams, suspensions, polymer solu- tions and melts), which, under appropriate circumstances, display shear-thinning, shear-thickening, visco-plastic, time-dependent and visco-elastic behaviour are pre- sented. Each type of non-Newtonian fluid behaviour has been illustrated via experi- mental data on realmaterials. This is followed by a short discussion on how to engi- neer non-Newtonian flow characteristics of a product for its satisfactory end use by manipulating its microstructure by controlling physico-chemical aspects of the sys- tem. Finally, we touch upon the ultimate question about the role of non-Newtonian characteristics on the analysis andmodeling of the processes of pragmatic engineer- ing significance},

  doi = {10.1016/j.compfluid.2011.10.003},
  abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis has become a useful research and design instrument albeit with errors and uncertainties. Appropriate standards and protocols for increasing confidence and reliabil- ity need to be identified and applied. These requirements become more relevant as improvements in hardware, software and user competence increase. Advances in these sectors have led to the increased use of CFD codes in the applied research industry. In the discussion on the opportunities of applying Quality Assurance to Research and Development (R\&D) activities, and on investigating methodologies (numerical or experimental), CFD results need to be qualified; rules, and procedures should be instated and followed. This paper proposes a methodolog- ical approach to qualify CFD, named Q3 approach. The approach is based on three interdependent, but related, dimensions: software reliability, user knowledge and process control. Applying the quality of CFD analysis to industrial problems, while following the principles of Quality Assurance, is of particular concerned. The paper aims to focus on the dimensions of user knowledge and process control, which are often overlooked and are of great importance when determining the qual- ity of CFD. The approach discussed here refers to a typical R\&D department in a Small or Medium Enter- prise (SME) where a CFD code is used as a support tool for process or product development, optimisation and/or innovation. Within the three dimensions, software reliability immediately refers to Verification and Validation (V\&V) procedures, a well known issue for those who are involved in code and model development. User knowledge and process control play a vital role in achieving accurate results and cannot be neglected, as per the principles of Quality Assurance. Therefore it is vital to provide continuous CFD analyst training to industrial professionals. Applying a CFD cycled process, which refers to the cyclic logic proposed in Qual- ity Assurance, may face some constrains in specific industrial scenarios. A protocol will serve as an instru- ment of process control. Within the protocol, the phases of Calculation, Verification and Validation as well as User Defined Model Verification represent critical elements, and are specifically detailed and struc- tured in accordance with the RADAR logic (Results, Approach, Deploy, Assess, Refine) used for Quality Assurance Management. In the case a specific study does not rely on experimental data, an alternative is proposed. The protocol is designed as a single tool that responds to both the need for qualified CFD and the requirement of internal or external audit of Quality Assurance (as far as calculations are concerned), thus increasing cost and personnel efficiency},

  title = {Drag Force in Random Arrays of Mono- and Bidisperse Spheres},
  abstract = {Fluid-particle contact is essential in many processes in the chemical, petrochemical,
metallurgical and food processing industry. A reactor type which
is particularly successful in establishing a thorough contact between fluid
and particles, and has excellent heat and mass transfer properties, is the
fluidised bed reactor. In these reactors the interaction between fluid and
particles \{drag force) balances the gravity acting on the particles, with the
effect that the particles 'float' in the reactor, which enhances mixing properties.
The hydrodynamics of fluidised bed reactors are very complex, which has
caused severe problems in the design and scale-up of these reactors in the
past. Computational Fluid Dynamics \{CFD) models may form an important
tool in this process, as they provide the possibility to study the influence
of several parameters in a cost efficient way. In the multilevel modemng
approach a continuum model is used to simulate engineering scale
fluidised bed . The clo ures which de cribe the effective particle-particle
interaction can be obtained from discrete particle simulations, whereas the
closures describing the effective fluid-particle interaction can be obtained
from lattice-Boltzmann simulations. This thesis focuses on the last item:
the derivation of accurate drag closures from lattice-Boltzmann simulations.
The fluid-particle interaction \{drag force) is an essential element of modelling
fluidised bed reactors, that is, accurate closures are required to obtain
realistic results from the higher order models. Currently combinations of
the Ergun and Wen and Yu models are often used. However, these equations
are 40 to 50 years old and their validity has recently been questioned.
Furthermore, they do not take into account the effects of polydispersity and
inhomogeneities that occur in practical applications.
The lattice-Boltzmann simulations of monodisperse systems showed that for low Reynolds numbers the Kozeny-Carman equation is a good description of
the drag force at high packing fractions. For more dilute systems a correction
is necessary to ensure that the drag force docs not vanish in the limit \textsterling{} --4 1,
which would follow from the Kozeny-Carman equation. For intermediate
and high Reynolds numbers the results for the drag force showed a behaviour
that is not a linear function of the Reynolds number, contrary to what is
often assumed. The simulation data were compared to several literature
models, none of which proved accurate over the entire range of porosities
and Reynolds numbers. Therefore, a new relation is presented that fits the
simulation data over the entire range of Reynolds numbers (0 \vphantom{\}\}\}}$<$ Re $<$ 1000)
and porosities (0.4 $<$ e: $<$ 0.9) with an average deviation of only 3 \%. In the
limit of e: --4 1, this relation yields a drag coefficient which is close to the
ex$\mu$re!:$>$l$>$iou l$>$y TurLou a.ml Levern;$\mu$iel (1986), whid1 provides Llie !.$>$est fit to
the experimental data for the drag on a single sphere.
Simulations of binary mixtures were performed with various diameter ratios
(0.25 $<$ di/d2 $<$ 0.7), porosities (0.35 $<$ e: $<$ 0.9), mixture compositions
and Reynolds numbers (0 $<$ (Re) $<$ 500). The relation that was derived
from the monodisperse simulations proved capable of predicting the overall
pressure drop over a binary system with an average deviation of less than
5 \%. The drag force acting on an individual particle in a binary system
was shown to be very different from the drag force on the same particle in a
monodisperse system with identical porosity and Reynolds number. In order
to correct for the effect of polydispersity, a new relation was derived from
theoretical considerations using the Kozeny-Carman approximation. This
relation was shown to be in very good agreement with the simulation data
for all porosities and Reynolds numbers, provided that the diameter ratios
are not very extreme. $\backslash$Vith an extra term the average deviation from the
simulation results for the individual particle drag force was reduced to 4.5 \%
over the entire range. Simulations of a polydisperse system, consisting of
four particle species, indicated that the validity of the correction factor is
not limited to bidisperse systems. I t is stressed that the difference between
predictions from a model with this correction term and predictions from
the classical drag models may be up to a factor of 5. The model that was
originally proposed by Patwardhan and Tien (1985) gave similarly accurate
results for the drag force on individual particles, but only after modification
to incorporate the correct average diameter. For the use in larger scale
numerical codes, the explicit expression suggested in this work will be far
more practical. Pressure drop measurements in mono- and bidisperse packed beds were performed
in order to experimentally validate the numerical results. For low
Reynolds numbers the agreement with the new relation was excellent, with
an average deviation of around 5 \%. In the intermediate Reynolds number
regime the deviations were much larger (around 24 \%) and systematic. It is
anticipated that some systematic error was introduced in the calculation of
the porosity or the viscosity. The deviation decreases for higher Reynolds
numbers.
The new drag relations were implemented in the discrete particle model,
with which two types of simulations were done: ( i) the formation of a single
bubble by a jet, and (ii) the segregation of a mixture of particles of different
sizes. The results were compared to experiments with similar systems, where
the focus was in particular on the effect of the boundary conditions and the
drag models. From the single bubble simulations it could be concluded that
a fine grid is necessary to obtain realistic structures in the bed. No definite
conclusion could be drawn about the best drag model, although it should be
noted that the Ergun/Wen and Yu model overestimated the bubble size. The
difference between the model of Hill et al. (2001b) and the new model was
negligible. The segregation simulations showed that the correction factor for
polydispersity improves the predictions for the segregation rate considerably.
The combination of the new drag relation and the correction factor gave
the best results for the segregation rate. However, a one-to-one comparison
proved difficult, since the segregation rate was found to be somewhat effected
by the type of boundary conditions employed in the simulations.
A calculation of the inversion velocity in mixtures that differ in size and
density showed that the new drag model is capable of predicting reasonably
accurate values for this velocity. The correct trend was predicted when the
composition is changed, in contrast to many literature relations.
Finally, the drag force in clusters was studied using lattice-Boltzmann simulations.
The drag coefficient of irregularly shaped particles (clusters with
zero inter-particle distance) agreed very well with literature values. When
the inter-particle distance was increased, the drag force on the cluster increased
as well due to the development of flow in between the particles. The
drag force that individual particles in the clusters e$>$.."Jlerience was shown to
depend heavily on the shielding by other particles.},

  abstract = {Turbulent boundary layers constitute one of the basic building blocks for understanding turbulence, particularly relevant for industrial applications. Although the geometries in technical but also geophysical applications are complicated and usually feature curved surfaces, the flow case of a canonical boundary layer developing on a flat surface has emerged as an important setup for studying wall turbulence, both via experimental and numerical studies. However, only recently spatially developing turbulent boundary layers have become accessible via direct numerical simulations (DNS). The difficulties of such setups are mainly related to the specification of proper inflow conditions, the triggering of turbulence and a careful control of the free-stream pressure gradient. In addition, the numerical cost of such spatial simulations is high due to the long, wide and high domains necessary for the full development of all relevant turbulent scales. We consider a canonical turbulent boundary layer under zero-pressure-gradient via large-scale DNS. The boundary layer is allowed to develop and grow in space. The inflow is a laminar Blasius boundary layer, in which laminar-turbulent transition is triggered by a random volume force shortly downstream of the inflow. This trip force, similar to a disturbance strip in an experiment (Schlatter and {\"O}rl{\"u}, 2010; Schlatter et al., 2009), is located at a low Reynolds number to allow the flow to develop over a long distance. The simulation covers thus a long, wide and high domain starting at Re theta =180 extending up to the (numerically high) value of Re theta =4300, based on momentum thickness theta and free-stream velocity U $\infty$. Fully turbulent flow is obtained from Re theta $\approx$500. The numerical resolution for the fully spectral numerical method (Chevalier et al., 2007) is in the wall-parallel directions eltax +=9 and eltaz +=4, resolving the relevant scales of motion. The simulation domain requires a total of 8$\cdot$109 grid points in physical space, and was thus run massively parallel with 4096 processors},

  title = {Dynamic Modeling of Thermo-Fluid Systems with Focus on Evaporators},
  volume = {0},
  abstract = {Mathematical modeling and simulation are important tools in the optimization of design, production and maintenance of engineering systems. Modelica\texttrademark{} is an open standard language for modeling of multi-domain systems featuring the important concept of acausal modeling and object-oriented modeling. Component models are arranged in model libraries facilitating easy reuse of models. The features available in Modelica have not yet been fully explored within the domain of thermo-fluid systems and the present work is one attempt in this direction. This thesis describes the development of a general model library called ThermoTwoPhase for dynamic modeling of thermo-fluid systems. Dynamic modeling of two-phase flows found in evaporators has received particular attention and various types of two- phase flow models are implemented giving a selection of models on different levels of complexities. The experiences from designing the ThermoTwoPhase library are summarized in a new modeling procedure called the Modeling V, which describes how to build a well-structured model library using a standardized modeling methodology. Within control and optimization of evaporators, the location of the liquid dry-out front is of particular interest. Moving boundary (MB) models is a low order two-phase model type, where the boundaries of the flow regions are computed using lumped control volumes with variable boundaries. A new general MB-model is proposed, which includes all three flow regions (sub-cooled, two-phase and superheated). Various reduction techniques are applied on the MB-model of a dry-expansion evaporator resulting in a variety of new reduced order models. Simulation results are compared to experimental data showing very good agreement in the location of the liquid dry-out front. The reduced MB-models are seen to capture the essential dynamics of the system and are thus important special cases. Discretized models based on the balance equations of mass, momentum and energy form an alternative to MB-models when the spatial changes are important. The applicable discretized models for heat exchangers within refrigeration are identified from a classification scheme based on the mathematical model structure. Three existing models are tested and showed not to work well on a set of boundary conditions commonly encountered in industry ( m h pout ) . A new homogeneous  in , in , discretized model is developed assuming the pressure changes to propagate instantaneously. Simulation results of the location of the liquid dry-out front agree well with experimental data giving similar accuracy as the MB-models.},

  title = {Control System on a Wind Turbine},
  abstract = {The aim for this project is to prepare a wind turbine controller and a wind turbine
computer model suitable for controller development. The wind turbine is a Vestas V27,
and the wind turbine drive train is modified by ChapDrive with a specified hydraulic
transmission. Both the pitch and the rotor speed can be regulated for the modified wind
turbine. The model is primarily based on a set of given wind turbine rotor characteristics,
transmission specifications and transmission test data. The controller does not rely on an
accurate wind speed gauge, since it can be difficult to realize.
A control strategy was developed with special emphasis on energy efficiency for the
modified wind turbine. Efficiency test data from the transmission prototype were only
available for a limited operating range, so a final control strategy could not be confirmed
for the whole operating range. Despite of the limited transmission efficiency data the
traditional wind turbine control strategy including operation at a constant tip speed ratio
is rejected. Calculations clearly show that the transmission efficiency is affecting how the
wind turbine should be operated. The strategy includes details on how to ideally control
the pitch and the rotor speed for different wind conditions. Following the strategy is
realized without using an accurate wind gauge.
The developed wind turbine controller was tested showing good results. It was tested
against a turbulent wind model that is developed as a part of the project. The described
controller concept could possibly be developed further for implementation in the
modified Vestas V27. It should be stressed that alternative controller realization concepts
should be considered before a final decision is made.
Further work on this topic should be dedicated to clarify the ideal control strategy for the
whole operating range of the wind turbine. This requires more information on the
transmission prototype or a more accurate transmission model.},

After a description of commonly observed flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes, some different types of flow pattern maps are discussed. Experimental techniques for direct and indirect determination of flow regimes are reviewed. These include direct viewing, photography, X-ray and statistical analysis of fluctuations in measured pressure or void fraction which yield power spectral density and probability density functions. The recent advances in the use of neutron noise analysis are also discussed. Flow regime transition criteria based on correlations and theoretical derivations are covered next. Finally, the effects of wall roughness, heat flux and flow acceleration on flow regime transitions are discussed. Throughout the paper an attempt has been made to identify the areas where new development work is needed.},

  abstract = {The UK Chapter of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE UK) commissioned research
to illustrate the variety of usage of the terms architecture and architecting in the systems engineering
community. These terms, though widely used, are rarely strictly defined, and the meaning attributed to
the terms is not consistent even in formal publications. Using soft systems methodology, this research has
analyzed three published sources (MODAF [http://www.modaf.org.uk, 2008], The Art of Systems Architecting
by Maier and Rechtin [CRC Press, 2009], and ISO/IEC 42010 [2011]), and conducted a series of interviews
with systems architecting practitioners. This research was set in context by a historical review of the use
of the term systems architecting. Twelve contentious questions in systems architecting are discussed, and
six perspectives on systems architecting presented, including three basic worldviews of the relationship
between systems engineering and systems architecting. One model sees systems architecting as simply
a rebranding of systems engineering to broaden its appeal with no change in content. Another model sees
systems engineering restricted to its traditional processes, with systems architecting adding to systems
engineering through external processes. The final model, and the most popular among the systems
engineering community surveyed, sees systems architecting addressing shortcomings in traditional
sequential lifecycle models by stretching the content of systems engineering to include new elements
under the banner of systems architecting.},

No wonder, much finer books will be written in the future as the visionary aims of many nations in combining molecular chemistry, biology, transport and interfacial phenomena for the fundamental understanding of processes and capabilities of new materials will be achieved. Solid-liquid systems where solid particles with a wide range of physical properties, sizes ranging from nano- to macro- scale and concentrations varying from very dilute to highly concentrated, are suspended in liquids of different rheological behavior flowing in various regimes are taken up in this book. Interactions among solid particles in molecular scale are extended to aggregations in the macro scale and related to settling, flow and rheological behavior of the suspensions in a coherent, sequential manner. The classical concept of solid particles is extended to include nanoparticles, colloids, microorganisms and cellular materials. The flow of these systems is investigated under pressure, electrical, magnetic and chemical driving forces in channels ranging from macro-scale pipes to micro channels. Complementary separation and mixing processes are also taken under consideration with micro- and macro-scale counterparts.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10494-006-9051-5},
  abstract = {We give an overview on the usage of computer simulations in industrial
turbulent dispersed multiphase flows. We present a few examples of industrial flows:
bubble columns and bubbly pipe flows, stirred tanks, cyclones, and a fluid catalytic
cracking unit. The fluid catalytic cracking unit is used to illustrate the complexity of
the physical phenomena involved, and the possibilities and limitations of the different
approaches used: Eulerian\textendash{}Lagrangian (particle-tracking) and Eulerian\textendash{}Eulerian
(two-fluid). In the first approach, the continuous phase is solved using either RANS
simulations (Reynolds-Averaged Navier\textendash{}Stokes simulations) or DNS/LES (Direct
Numerical Simulations/Large-Eddy Simulations), and the individual particles are
tracked. In the second approach, the dispersed phase is averaged, leading to two
sets equations, which are quite similar to the RANS equations of single-phase flows.
The Eulerian\textendash{}Eulerian approach is the most commonly used in industrial applications,
however, it requires a significant amount of modelling. Eulerian\textendash{}Lagrangian
RANS can be simpler to use; in particular in situations involving complex boundary
conditions, polydisperse flows and agglomeration/breakup. The key issue for the
success of the simulations is to have good models for the complex physics involved.
A major weakness is the lack of good models for: the turbulence modification
promoted by the particles, the inter-particle interactions, and the near-wall effects.
Eulerian\textendash{}Lagrangian DNS/LES can play an important role as a research tool, in
order to get a better physical understanding, and to improve the models used in the
RANS simulations (either Eulerian\textendash{}Eulerian or Eulerian\textendash{}Lagrangian).},

The material is well organized, readable and fundamental to learning how to think like a systems engineer and carry out best practices in the field. Since systems engineering is still developing as a discipline, there have been new concepts and practices that have entered the field since the text was published in 2003. As an increasing number of students have used the text, topics have been discovered that would benefit from expansion, integration and clarification. The proposed second edition will be developed by colleagues of the original authors to upgrade this unique interdisciplinary guide to systems engineering to maintain relevance and currency in this rapidly changing and demanding field"--},

  abstract = {The purpose of this thesis work has been to analyze the usability and the feasibility for modeling with MathWorks simulation tool Simscape by building a simplified model of the automatic gearbox ZF-ECOMAT 4 (HP 504 C / HP 594 C / HP 604 C). It has been shown throughout the thesis how this model is build. First has system knowledge been acquired by studying relevant literature and speaking with the persons concerned. The second step was to get acquainted with Simscape and the physical network approach. The physical network approach that is accessible through the Simscape language makes is easy to build custom made components with means of physical and mathematical relationships. With this background a stepwise approach been conducted which has led to the final model of the gearbox and the validation concept. The results from this thesis work indicates that Simscape is a powerful tool for modeling physical systems and the results of the model validation gives a good sign that it is possible to build and simulate physical models with the Simscape software. However, during the modeling of the ZF-ECOMAT 4 some things have been discovered which could improve the usability of the tool and make the learning curve for an inexperienced user of physical modeling tools less steep. In particular, a larger model library should be included from the beginning, more examples of simple and more complex models, the object-oriented related parts such as own MATLAB functions should be expanded, and a better troubleshooting guidance.},

This chapter focuses on various issues related to gas hydraulics in pipelines used in oil fields. The problems of the simultaneous flow of oil and gas or of oil, gas, and water through one pipe have become increasingly important in oil field production operations. The problems are complex, as the properties of two or more fluids must be considered and because of the different patterns of fluid flows, depending upon the flow conditions. These patterns, in any given line, may change as the flow conditions change, and they may be coexistent at different points of the line. More than twenty correlations have been developed by different investigators for predicting the pressure drop in the two-phase flow. Under the project, sponsored jointly by the American Petroleum Institute and American Gas Association at the University of Houston, five of these correlations were tested by comparing them with 2,620 experimental measurements culled from more than 15,000 available. The statistical part of the report on the project concludes that of the five correlations tested, the Loekhart-Martinelli correlation shows the best agreement with the experimental data, particularly for pipe sizes commonly used in oil field production operations. Very little is known about the effect on the pressure drop of addition to the gas-oil system of a third phase, an immiscible liquid water. Formation of an emulsion results in increased viscosities. Formulas are available for approximate determination of viscosity of emulsion, if viscosity of oil and percent of water content of oil is known. For solution of three-phase flow problems of oil field flow lines, the oil and water are considered as one phase and the gas as the other phase.},

  title = {Design of a Thermo-Hydraulic Model Library in {{Modelica}}},
  abstract = {A new language called Modelica\^O for hierarchical physical systems modeling is developed in an international effort. The main objectives are to make it easy to exchange models and model libraries between tools and to use object-oriented constructs to facilitate the reuse of modeling knowledge. To promote the idea of a unified modeling language for continuous and hybrid systems, public domain model libraries for basic models are developed in various application domains. This paper deals with the design of a base library for thermo-hydraulic applications. Requirements for the library are derived from representative simulation examples and special care is taken to cover the basic physical phenomena broadly. Accurate and fast calculations for thermodynamic properties of fluids constitute a very important and intricate part of thermo-hydraulic calculations, therefore they are given much attention. The state equations for the transport of mass, momentum and energy are formulated in a very general way in order to allow application oriented simplifications in derived classes. Constitutive equation submodels (e. g., for heat transfer coefficients) complete the set of basic building blocks. Modelicas unique language features1 of class parameters and multiple inheritance are extensively used in order to structure the library for intuitive use by model-users and maximum code reuse by model-developers. The library is under development now.},
