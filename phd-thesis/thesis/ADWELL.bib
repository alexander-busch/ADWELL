  abstract = {Shape optimization is an interesting option when faced with uncertainties of a
design. It may help the designer come to a better understanding of the behavior of a
product and even suggest an optimal solution based on a certain criteria. Since a lot
of the methods for optimization are general there are softwares dedicated for solving
optimization problems independent of the application. This means that as long as
one can formulate a problem and the optimum of that problem in mathematical
terms these softwares can assist in ⬚nding the optimal solution to that problem.
This project is aimed at coupling such an optimization software, namely an Open-
Source code called Dakota, with the 
uid dynamics calculation toolbox OpenFOAM
to enable parameterized shape optimization of objects in a 
ow.
This report will do mainly two things. Firstly it will describe and discuss the two
software, their capabilities in terms of parameterized shape optimization and their
limitations. It will describe a new boundary condition implemented in OpenFOAM
to complement the existing functions to better allow for parameterized shape opti-
mization. Secondly it will describe one way of coupling the softwares, what ⬚les are
necessary and how to set up a simulation with the new boundary condition.},

  title = {Flow Regimes of Particle Settling in Suspensions and Non-{{Newtonian}} Fluids with Relevance to Cuttings Transport during Drilling.Pdf},
  volume = {22},
  abstract = {Settling velocities of cuttings particles in drilling fluid (“mud”) is one of the most important parameters for the efficiency of drilling long deviated wells. Numerical simulators have been developed worldwide to assist the optimization of cuttings transport. Models for particle settling velocities to enter these simulators are based on experimental conditions which not always reflect the situation they are used for in industrial processes.
Effects which modify and disturb settling velocities are drillstring movement, liquid convection and turbulence, cuttings particles size and shape, particle-particle interaction, and - most important - the drilling mud rheology and composition. This also includes oil-water dispersions and also free gas in the mud.
The experimental work of this paper has been developed to a large extent in connection with a Master thesis1 at the University of Stavanger. The motivation for the study was to determine the impact of flow regimes on settling modes and falling velocities.
In the present paper the main focus is on theoretical aspects and analysis methods involved. More results from the laboratory tests will be described in the presentation for the NRS 2014 Conference.
Laboratory experiments using high speed video recordings were used to reveal some of these effects. As might be expected, the settling flow regimes and are quite different for Newtonian versus non-Newtonian liquids. Finally, we describe image analysis assisted determination of fall speeds},

  abstract = {The rheology of a non-Newtonian Bingham fluid is sensitive to the highest shear rates in a turbulent flow. High shear rate events are associated with small-scale interactions near the dissipation range of turbulence. Statistical Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow solvers, commonly used to model turbulence, capture directly only the large-scale mean-flow features. The effects of small-scale interactions are incorporated and modeled. To extend the RANS modeling approach for a non-Newtonian Bingham fluid into the turbulence regime, a special submodel is required that estimates high shear rate magnitudes using the solved-variables from RANS as input. The significance of this work is that it introduces a potential high-shear rate submodel for RANS modeling of turbulent non-Newtonian Bingham fluids, implemented in STAR-CCM+, and provides a preliminary assessment of model results versus data.},

The cuttings used in the experiments have densities ranging from 1.17 to 4.10 g/cm3 and diameters from 0.2 to 5.06 mm. The fluids used are water, CMC drilling fluid and the drilling fluid for the continental deep drilling project in F.R. Germany (KTB). Two settling patterns of cuttings have been observed- stable settling and swinging settling. For particles with reynolds number greater than 100, the cutting settling is swinging, whereas the settling is stable for particles with reynolds number smaller than 100. New predictive expressions for the drag coefficient of cuttings and for the settling velocity of cuttings are developed for both stable settling and swinging settling.},

The results showed that the particle drag coefficient is a function of the particle Reynolds number and, in the case of power-law-model fluids, of the flow behavior index.

The erosion rate tests of three beds with different bed particle-size ranges show that beds with intermediate average particle size have the maximum erosion rate. The theoretical analysis using a mechanistic model supports this observation. The instantaneous acceleration of bed particles at the beginning of transportation is correlated with particle removal rate. It is shown that the mechanistic model can predict optimum operating parameters to improve the efficiency of hole cleaning.},

  abstract = {The standard assumption in the phenomenological theory of constitutive relations for non-Newtonian
fluids is that the Cauchy stress tensor is a function of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient. By discussing
experimental data available in the literature we show that the classical framework is overly
restrictive. A simple framework that goes beyond the standard approach is the novel concept of implicit
constitutive relations. Here, the basic assumption is that the relation between the stress and the symmetric
part of the velocity gradient is given by an implicit tensorial equation. We demonstrate that the
implicit type constitutive relations are adequate for fitting the one dimensional (shear stress versus shear
rate) experimental data, and we speculate about the possible form of the corresponding three
dimensional (Cauchy stress tensor versus symmetric part of the velocity gradient) implicit constitutive
relations. Using the representation theorem for isotropic tensorial functions we conjecture that the
implicit constitutive relations could lead to novel models capable to describe nonzero normal stress differences.
Finally, we provide an example of a nontrivial thermodynamically and dynamically admissible
implicit type tensorial constitutive relation. The simple model does predict nonzero normal stress
difference, and shows that the conjecture is correct.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2013.04.006},
  abstract = {Computations of liquid–solid slurries in horizontal pipes are performed to investigate the complex multiphase flow dynamics associated with operating conditions above and below the critical deposition velocity. A high-fidelity large eddy simulation framework is combined with a Lagrangian particle tracking solver to account for polydispersed settling particles in a fully developed turbulent flow. The two phases are fully coupled via volume fraction and momentum exchange terms, and a two-step filtering process is employed to alleviate any dependence of the liquid-phase mesh size on the particle diameter, enabling the capture of a wide range of spatial turbulent scales. A fully conservative immersed boundary method is employed to account for the pipe geometry on a uniform Cartesian mesh. Two cases are simulated, each with a pipe geometry and particle size distribution matching an experimental study from Roco \& Balakrishnam, which considers a mean volumetric solid concentration of 8.4\%, corresponding to just over 16 million particles. The first case considers a Reynolds number based on the bulk flow of the liquid of 85,000, resulting in a heterogeneous suspension of particles throughout the pipe cross-section. Statistics on the concentration and velocity of the particle phase for this case show excellent agreement with experimental results. The second case considers a lower Reynolds number of 42,660, leading to the formation of a stationary bed of particles. Three distinct regions are identified in the second case, corresponding to a rigid bed at the bottom of the pipe, a highly-collisional shear flow just above the bed, and a dilute suspension of particles far from the bed. Computational results indicate segregation in particle size along the vertical direction, with the smallest particles located at the top, increasing monotonically until the bed surface, where the largest particles are located. The covariance of concentration and velocity of each phase is presented, giving further insight on the multiphase dynamics. Statistics on the individual mechanisms that contribute to the motion of each particle, namely forces due to drag, the pressure gradient and viscous stresses of the surrounding fluid, and collisions, are provided for each case. It is observed that for the majority of the pipe cross-section, the drag force dominates for each case, which is balanced by inter-particle collisions in the streamwise direction, and by gravity in the vertical direction. Simulation results are also used to investigate closures from Reynolds average modeling of multiphase flows.},

Many of the flows of interest are turbulent, which presents a complex problem to analyze or to determine the dominant physical processes contributing to the observed phenomena. Advances in experimental techniques have made it possible to measure directly turbulent and particle velocity fluctuations in dilute systems. This has provided a counterpart to advances in computational and analytical models and a basis on which to test these models. Three specific areas are considered: the fluctuating forces on an individual particle in an unsteady flow, the response of a solid particle to a turbulent air flow, and the corresponding response of a small bubble in turbulent liquid flows. Results from direct numerical simulations are presented for each of these, including the nonuniform distribution of particles generated by local instantaneous features of the flow. The issue of turbulence modulation at low to moderate void fractions is discussed.},

  title = {The Role of the Turbulent Scales in the Settling Velocity of Heavy Particles in Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence},
  volume = {371},
  abstract = {The average settling velocity of heavy particles under a body force ⬚eld is studied
numerically in stationary homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows generated by the
direct numerical simulation and the large eddy simulation of the continuity and
Navier\{Stokes equations. The flow ⬚elds corresponding to di⬚erent selected ranges of
turbulent scales are obtained by ⬚ltering the results of the direct numerical simulation,
and employed for calculating the particle motion. Wang \& Maxey (1993) showed that
as a consequence of the particle accumulation in the low vorticity region and the
preferential sweeping phenomenon, the average settling rate in turbulence is greater
than that in still fluid. In the present study, the phenomenon of particle accumulation
in the low vorticity region is found to be controlled mainly by the small scales
with wavenumber k! corresponding to the maximum of the dissipation (vorticity)
spectrum. However, the increase of the average settling rate, h⬚vS i, also depends
strongly on the large energetic eddies. The small eddies with wavenumber greater
than 2:5k! have essentially no e⬚ect on the particle accumulation and the average
settling velocity. The large eddy simulation is thus adequate for the present study

  abstract = {Transportation of the fluid and slurry (fluid and solid particles mixture) in the pipe and annulus space has been the focus of numerous studies. There are different parameters to be considered when studying slurry transportation. These include slurry velocity or flow rates; fluid properties such as density and rheology; and solid particles properties including concentration, density, shape and size. Also the angle of the flow conduit, rotation of the pipe and possible eccentricity of the annulus are other factors which influence slurry transport characteristics. Although a number of analytical, numerical and empirical equations as well as numerical simulations have been developed for studying the flow and slurry transport, the results need to be validated against either field or lab data. As performing field tests is costly and time consuming conducting simulations at laboratory scale appears as a good alternative. Different flow loops have been designed to study the slurry transport in different science and engineering disciplines including oil and gas and mining. However, few of these consider in particular cuttings transportation in small size annulus space. The flow characteristics appear to be very different when it travels within a small size annulus, in particular when the fluid velocity is high. In this study, a review of some of the existing slurry flow loops will be conducted. Then the details of a slurry loop which has been designed and commissioned for the purpose of studying cuttings transport in a small size annulus space for applications in drilling mineral exploration wells using coil tube technology will be presented.},

  title = {Particle Transportation in Turbulent Non-{{Newtonian}} Suspensions in Open Channels},
  abstract = {The turbulent behaviour of non-Newtonian suspensions in open channel conditions is investigated
here. There is a lack of fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in the transport of
suspension particles in non-Newtonian fluids, hence direct numerical simulation into the research is
a useful validation tool. A better understanding of the mechanism operating in the turbulent flow of
non-Newtonian suspensions in open channel would lead to improved design of many of the systems
used in the mining and mineral processing industries.
Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the turbulent flow of non-Newtonian fluids in an open
channel has been modelled using a spectral element-Fourier method. The simulation of a yield–
pseudoplastic fluid using the Herschel-Bulkley model agreed qualitatively with experimental results
from field measurements of mineral tailing slurries. The effect of variation of the flow behaviour
index has been investigated and used to assess the sensitivity of the flow to this physical parameter.
This methodology is seen to be useful in designing and optimising the transport of slurries in open
channels.
The aim of this work is to understand the underlying phenomena and mechanisms operating in the
turbulent flow of non-Newtonian suspensions in open channels, in particular their ability to
transport suspended particles. It is intended to achieve the following objectives:
• Demonstrate how the rheological characteristics of the continuous medium carrier
fluid influence the transport of solid particles in the suspension
• Carry out modification of existing computational model to describe the non-
Newtonian open channel flow and validate by experimental measurements
• Establish relationships between rheology of the fluid and turbulent characteristics of
the flow
• Establish relationships between rheology of the fluid and particle suspension in an
open channel flow
There is a substantial amount of literature on turbulent flow in pipe and open channel flow. In this
thesis, both experimental and computational studies for channel flow of non-Newtonian fluids have
been carried out. The prediction of the velocity profile and other parameters such as Reynolds
stresses and velocity fluctuations were compared with measurements of the same obtained in an
open channel. These results addressed the question of size, intensity and frequency of the turbulent
structures.
The existing computational code could not be used for open channel flow. It was therefore modified
by introducing new boundary conditions on free surface. Rheological parameters were also
incorporated in the computational code. Computational simulation was then validated against a
number of different experimental and computational results. Different velocity distributions were
tested to see the validity of the simulation.
Major investigations have been conducted to observe the effect of different rheological parameters
on the simulation results. The major contribution from this study is that the simulation method
provided the opportunity to examine the effect of changing one rheology parameter while keeping
the other parameters constant. The relationship between rheological parameters and flow
characteristics is Reynolds number dependent. It is concluded that the simulation can simulate non-
Newtonian turbulent open channel flow reasonably well. A further investigation on secondary
current was also conducted. It appears that with a smaller Reynolds number, weak and large size
turbulent structures appear in the middle region of the channel.
Furthermore, Stokes number, low velocity streaks intensities and sizes have been studied. It is
determined that the Reynolds number has more effects than rheological parameters on the low
velocity streak size. It is found that the largest percentage of ejection and sweep events occurred
away from the centreline and close to the wall at a height 10-20 cm from the bottom. It is already
known that particles are easier to be suspended and re-suspended in those areas. In addition, it is
also reinforced that the secondary current cell can assist the re-suspension of particles.
This study of non-Newtonian suspension flow in open channel will provide fundamental
information for understanding the behaviour of fluid structure and the relationship between fluid
and particles. This information will also be applicable to the design and operation of industrial channels for the transport of mineral suspensions leading to improved channel management and
economic outcomes.},

Once a single-phase model had been validated, a coupled

were chosen. CFD is implemented using OpenFOAM®,
and DEM using LIGGGHTS. These two different codes
were coupled via another programme called CFDEM. This
coupled model is currently capable of modelling spherical
particles in a suspending liquid. DLVO forces have been
included in some models to account for inter-particle
forces due to the surface charge on the particles. The
coupled model is currently being validated. Preliminary
results show good qualitative behaviour of the model.},

  abstract = {The paper describes a theory of particle deposition based formally on the conservation equations of particle mass and momentum. These equations are formulated in an Eulerian coordinate system and are then Reynolds averaged, a procedure which generates a number of turbulence correlations, two of which are of prime importance. One represents ‘turbulent diffusion’ and the other ‘turbophoresis’, a convective drift of particles down gradients of mean-square fluctuating velocity. Turbophoresis is not a small correction; it dominates the particle dynamic behaviour in the diffusion-impaction and inertia-moderated regimes.Adopting a simple model for the turbophoretic force, the theory is used to calculate deposition from fully developed turbulent pipe flow. Agreement with experimental measurements is good. It is found that the Saffman lift force plays an important role in the inertia-moderated regime but that the effect of gravity on deposition from vertical flows is negligible. The model also predicts an increase in particle concentration close to the wall in the diffusion-impaction regime, a result which is partially corroborated by an independent ‘direct numerical simulation’ study.The new deposition theory represents a considerable advance in physical understanding over previous free-flight theories. It also offers many avenues for future development, particularly in the simultaneous calculation of laminar (pure inertial) and turbulent particle transport in more complex two- and three-dimensional geometries.},

  volume = {7},
  abstract = {Problem statement: Oil well cleaning is the ability of a drilling fluid to suspend and
transport drilled cuttings from the down hole (bit face) to the surface. The cleaning performance was
affected by many factors such as fluid viscosity, annular flow velocity, angle of inclination and drill
cuttings size and shape and. Approach: Navier-Stoke equations, the continuity equation and the power
law of non-Newtonian viscosity model were adopted to establish the mathematical model of the cutting
transport process in the annulus of the well. The constants of the power law model were evaluated
experimentally for three different mud types. The CFD simulation to solve the governing equations
was carried out by using FLUENT commercial code. The specifications of the particles, the pumping
head and feeding conditions were obtained from a drilling site in Sudan. Results: Simulation of the
mud flow in the annulus had shown that in spite of the laminar nature of the flow, the velocity profile
was flattening over wide area of the annulus. Such condition was referred to as fog flow and was
preferable to produce uniform drag distribution to lift the particles without rotation during the
transportation process. The analysis had been conducted for various mud charging rates ranging from
600-900 GPM, in 30° diverted orientation well. The investigation of cuttings size was conducted for
2.54, 4.45 and 7 mm. Also, the effect of the cuttings shape with 1, 0.9 and 0.85 was investigated and it
was found that higher sphereicity have better cleaning efficiency. Conclusion: The analyses revealed
that for 30° diverted orientation; the effective cleaning performance was achieved when the drilling
mud charging was higher than 800 GPM for all types of tested cuttings. The simulation results
revealed that there was a significant effect of the cuttings size on the cuttings transport. Fine particles
are the easiest to clean out.},

  abstract = {Efficient transportation of cuttings is a vital factor for a good drilling program. Cutting transport in annulus is a complex problem that is affected by numerous parameters. Predicting effective cuttings transport requires all of these parameters to be considered simultaneously. To better understand the effects of some of the parameters affecting the cutting transportation, a combination of casing-drill pipe annulus section was simulated and a model called ‘discrete phase model’ was used to observe the transportation of cuttings in the annulus. Tests were conducted to determine the effects of mud weight, particle size, drilling rate and viscosity on cutting transportation in both vertical and horizontal section of a well bore. The data collected were graphically correlated in the form of annular velocity with cutting transportation, which was used as a measure of the transportation efficiency. The results indicate that for the same drilling fluid horizontal well has better hole cleaning than vertical well. The results also indicate that the effectiveness of a circulating fluid in removing drilled cuttings is not only dependent on the rheology of the fluid but also on whether the fluid is in laminar or turbulent flow. For the tested particle size ranges (0.10 to 0.275 in.), the cleaning efficiency is partly dependent upon the particle’s size.},

  abstract = {In a drilling operation hole cleaning plays an important role. Improper hole cleaning can lead to problems like reduced penetration rate, torque and drag increase, and increase in pipe sticking potential. Cutting transport in a wellbore is a complex problem affected by several parameters such as mud density, cutting size and density, rate of penetration and mud circulation rate. Researchers conducted experiments with different setups representing annulus flow in a limited number of hole sizes to investigate the contribution of several physical and operating conditions. Due to time and cost involved in the construction and conduction of the experiments all reported studies are limited to physical model dimensions and operating parameters. In this study, we introduced a new approach to determine the parameters affecting cutting transport in any wellbore. This method utilizes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software program. The effectiveness of selected program was determined by simulating successfully results from an experiment reported in literature. Presented in this study are the effects of cutting and mud properties on the cutting transport efficiency for vertical and horizontal wellbores. This approach eliminates the need for expensive laboratory setups and can be used to study unlimited number of physical and operational conditions in any wellbore.},

  abstract = {The need for technologies to reduce cost and improve recovery from existing hydrocarbon reservoirs is well established. One of the most effective methods of cost reduction relies on improvement of drilling technologies. Particularly, understanding the parameters that control hole cleaning is beneficial especially in both horizontal and deviated wells. For this purpose, a section of casing-drill pipe annulus section was simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics to determine the effects of fluid velocity, cutting size, rate of penetration, drill pipe rotation and inclination angle in deviated wells. The Eulerian Model Simulations were conducted at steady state and the results of the data collected for maximum cutting concentrations in the annulus were graphically analyzed. Formation of cutting beds is noticed near the entry section of the annulus and the transport of the cuttings in the annular section occurs in the form of stratified flow. Fluid flow rate, angle of inclination and rate of penetration have a major impact on cutting concentrations and proper prediction of these parameters are important to avoid formation of cutting beds. It is also noted that drillpipe rotation can enhance cutting transport but it generally has a greater effect on smaller sized particles.},

  abstract = {Horizontal pipe flow of coarse particle slurries with carrier fluids which exhibited a yield stress were examined. Experimental measurements were made to investigate the effect the fluid yield stress
had on the transport of the coarse particles. These results were used to evaluate two numerical models intended to describe these flows.
Experimental tests used clay suspensions which were found to follow the Bingham fluid model The suspensions had large yield stresses which were capable of supporting the particles when the fluid was stationary. The coarse particles were large in relation to the pipe size. Slurry flows were mostly laminar but turbulent flows were also observed.
The first numerical model considered the laminar flow of slurries by representing them as a continua with a viscosity which varied with position in the pipe. A finite element method was used
to predict the velocity distribution in the pipe from a specified pressure gradient and coarse particle
concentration profile. This velocity distribution was used to predict a concentration distribution based on a dispersive mechanism in laminar flow.
The second numerical model was mechanistically based and represented the slurries by two stratified layers with different coarse particle concentrations. This model was used in both laminar and
turbulent flow. The effects of the fluid yield stress on model predictions were considered.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed in the present study to gain insight into the concentration profile of solid liquid slurry flow in pipelines. The preliminary simulations highlighted the need for the correct modeling of the interphase drag force. In light of the shortcomings of appropriate drag co-efficient model (namely Syamlal O’-Brien model, Gidaspow model and Wen \& Yu model), an effort was made in the present study to modify the existing models to incorporate the effect of solid concentration at drag co-efficient. A two-dimensional user defined model was then developed using CFD to understand the influence of the particle drag coefficient on solid concentration profile. The proposed correlation was then incorporated in a two-fluid model (Euler-Euler) along with the standard k-ε turbulence model with mixture properties to simulate the turbulent solid-liquid flow in a pipeline. The predicted results show reasonably good agreement with the experimental data. The computational model and results discussed in this work would be useful for extending the applications of CFD models for simulating large slurry pipelines.},

Pipe rotation is a considerable parameter affecting pressure losses in annulus during drilling. In this study, pressure losses of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids flowing through concentric horizontal annulus are predicted using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and support vector regression (SVR). SVR and CFD results are compared with experimental data obtained from literature. The comparisons show that CFD model could predict frictional pressure gradient with an average absolute percent error less than 3.48\% for Newtonian fluids and 19.5\% for non-Newtonian fluids. SVR could predict frictional pressure gradient with an average absolute percent error less than 5.09\% for Newtonian fluids and 5.98\% for non-Newtonian fluids.},

Von den Gleichungen, die die Strömung durch eine Kapillarröhre ausdrücken, ist d 4 (P−k) n Lq =1 die für Lösungen von Rohgummi in Benzol bis zu einer Konzentration von 1,2 Proz. am besten anwendbare. 2. Die Methode der Konsistenzbestimmung durch Benutzung dieser Gleichung hat den Vorteil, dasssie verwendbare Werte für alle praktischen Strömungsgeschwindigkeiten liefert und dasssie die Notwendigkeit, sehr hohe Drucke anzuwenden, vermeidet. 3. Die Vermeidung der hohen Drucke gestattet die Verwendung einer einfacheren Versuchsanordnung und vermindert den Fehler, der durch die Unsicherheit in der Anwendung der kinetischen Energiekorrektion verursacht wird. Es würde dies also möglich machen, das Ostwald-Viskosimeter zu benutzen bei mässigen äusseren Drucken, ohne Gefahr zu laufen, am Ende einer Messung Luft durch die Kapillare zu blasen. 4. Bei der Benutzung des logarithmischen Strömung-Druckdiagramms können genauere Uebereinstimmungen für Kapillaren verschiedener Dimensionen erhalten werden als bei Bestimmung von Scherungsmodul, Steifigkeit oder Beweglichkeit. 5. Die Materialkonstanten n und I werden aus der logarithmischen Kurve erhalten und nehmen beide mit der Konzentration zu. Verglichen mit Scherungsmodul und Bewegliċhkeit haben diese beiden Konstanten den Vorteil, dasssie beide die Strömung in demselben Sinne beeinflussen, also grössere Plastizität eines Stoffes grössere Werte für n und I bedingen würde. 6. K verschwindet bei grossen Kapillaren und geringen Konzentrationen oder ist zu klein, um ermittelt zu werden. Wenn K jedoch bestimmbar ist, wächst sein Wert mit Abnahme des Kapillarendurchmessers. K selbst ist keine Materialkonstante, aber weitere Untersuchungen sollen zeigen, dassaus ihm eine dritte Konstante berechnet werden kann.},

  abstract = {AbstractTaylor vortices, i.e., toroidal rings, are formed in an annulus when one pipe is rotated inside another. These rings form when the critical rotation rate (rpm) is reached. Equations are presented to calculate the critical rpm above which Taylor vortices form for both Newtonian and power law fluids. The theoretical computations show that under typical drilling rotation rates Taylor vortices do form.Experiments were conducted with a wide range of Newtonian and power law (shear thinning) fluids in a transparent annular geometry. The experimental values of critical rpm are in agreement with computed ones. Taylor vortices were clearly observed to form and did contribute to the lift of simulated drill cuttings.In Newtonian fluids, the lifting capability increased as the viscosity was increased. For power law (shear thinning) fluids, contrary to expectation, the lifting capability decreased as the apparent viscosity was increased. This was because increasing the polymer concentration in order to increase apparent viscosity also lowered the n' value of the fluid. Fluids with low n' values exhibit lower velocities close to the stationary walls. It can be inferred, therefore, that with regard to the transport of cuttings (by vortices or otherwise), high n' value fluids are more efficient.P. 77},

  abstract = {AbstractCoiled tubing (CT) is widely used in well intervention as a practical and cost-effective means of servicing wells. Over the years, the actual flow through CT has been a point of discussion and theory. Testing has been conducted to promote a better understanding of what happens inside the CT. In recent years, the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software has provided greater insight into actual CT flow patterns, including fluid-flow velocity profiles and secondary flow regimes. These flow patterns can be studied in a straight pipe or curved (CT) condition with variable flow rates and variable fluids. CFD could help us understand the phenomenon of erosion, including particle path and migration through the tubing. It might also lead to a greater understanding and efficient design of friction pressure gradients. After CFD is proven and established, an alternative to full-scale testing or other predictive methods may be possible.This paper discusses the flow phenomenon of CT using CFD, particularly over the tubing guide. This is an area of concern because the tubing configuration changes from straight to bent to straight again. Details of fluid flow for both the straight and curved sections have been examined to evaluate flow-velocity profiles and flow patterns. Fluids investigated have included water, gel, and slurry.IntroductionCT has long been used in the oil and gas industry to serve as an effective means for servicing wells. It is a faster and more cost-efficient process than conventional rig servicing. The application for CT varies widely and includes drilling, cementing, cleaning sand from a wellbore, fracturing, acidizing, scale removal, placement of tools, logging, fishing, and chemical placement.1-5 Many operators are attracted to CT processes because of its rapid deployment. The CT itself must be managed for life, safety, job design, and flow characteristics. Part of this management is understanding the events that occur inside the CT. For many years, flow through CT has only been a matter of discussion and theory. Some of the discussion has been related to whether flow through CT has the same characteristics as flow through standard tubing. Other discussions involve whether centrifugal forces play a part in the coiled or wrapped sections of the tubing. If centrifugal forces are involved, how do the secondary flow regimes effect the total flow? Mysteries have persisted until recently because many theories were hard to either prove or disprove. Theories can also change based on the fluid being used. For example, Newtonian fluids may act differently than non-Newtonian fluids, and the addition of sand or proppant can also affect results. Taking advantage of technologies used in other industries (such as CFD) can provide tools to help us understand fluid flow characteristics in CT. The better understanding of fluid flow through CT can lead to better job management, better job design, and more efficient use of CT and pumping equipment. This paper will describe some of the secrets to proper flow analysis, which can depend in large part on the way the software parameters are loaded and applied. CFD SoftwareThe use of CFD software has grown to become a large part of fluid dynamics investigation. In recent years, the use of CFD software in the oil and gas industry has steadily increased. This technology has allowed the modeling of complex physical fluid phenomena that in the past were extremely difficult to simulate or measure. The CFD software is a much more cost-effective means to investigate fluid systems and also provides more rapid results. When established, CFD software helps enable us to predict what will happen when single or multiple parameters change. For this study, FLUENT CFD software was used to study the flow characteristics of various fluids. These fluids included water modeled as a Newtonian fluid, gel modeled as a non-Newtonian fluid, and a sand-laden gel modeled as a non-Newtonian slurry. The geometry modeling was performed in 3-D solid-model format using SolidWorks software. The fluid domain of the CT geometry was exported in ACIS format from SolidWorks software to GAMBIT software. GAMBIT software is the preprocessor to FLUENT software where geometry is created, meshing is performed, and boundary conditions are established.},

  abstract = {AbstractWellbore fluid applications continue to expand in complexity, necessitating more versatile rheological and hydraulics models amenable to efficient real-time data analysis. Substantial recent advancements have been made by numerous workers, applying the Herschel-Bulkley model to drilling fluids, highlighting the underlying importance of fluid rheology. However, this classic model alone does not fully describe the complexity of oilfield fluids. Therefore, this paper presents a Generalized Herschel-Bulkley (GHB) rheological model and hydraulic analytical method that accommodate a broader spectrum of wellbore fluids, whether of simple character, or having the complex properties of multiphase fluids such as foamed cement and high-density cements in addition to drilling fluids.The GHB model offers several advantages: (1) it readily reduces to several popular conventional models (Newtonian, power-law, Bingham-plastic, Casson, and Herschel-Bulkley), (2) it can provide additional flexibility for characterizing apparent viscosity functions of current and future multiphase fluid systems such as lightweight cements, foams, and high-density slurries, and (3) it can provide an effective generalized framework for developing friction prediction equations. A highly accurate numerical simulator for the comprehensive family of fluids modeled by the GHB model was developed for predicting laminar flow-friction loss in pipes and annuli. The computational method, based on several exact integrals of motion, could be made as accurate as desired by decreasing mesh size. While the simulator itself is not ideal for real-time application, the results of comprehensive calculations using it were incorporated into field-usable software by developing "generalized explicit functions" that encapsulated all the physics correctly. These practical functions are in turn used for accurately and rapidly predicting friction loss of the GHB family of fluids in pipes and annuli (concentric and eccentric) for laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow.IntroductionConventional rheological models in widespread use for the past half-century in the oil industry include the Bingham-plastic, power-law, and Newtonian models. Of these, the Bingham-plastic is advantageous because it includes a yield point that is a positive shear stress at zero shear rate, which most drilling fluids, cement slurries, and spacers have. The power-law model (pseudoplastic) is especially useful for fluids containing noncrosslinked water-soluble polymers. Both of these can reduce to the Newtonian model, which can be accurately used in those cases where water, brine, or simple oils are used in wellbore fluid applications. More recently, the Herschel-Bulkley model has seen increased usage because it accommodates the existence of a yield point (Bingham-plastic) as well as the nonlinearity of the shear-stress to shear-rate relationship (power-law).Field Operation ChallengesThis paper examines field conditions where past rheological correlations become inaccurate. There are several reasons why cement job simulations predict much higher or lower surface pressures than those found on the actual job. These reasons include, but are not limited to the following:Casing centralizationNarrow annuliDeviated wellboresInaccurate prediction of low-end (low pump-rate) rheology valuesOf these four conditions, the industry has good control on mechanical factors, casing centralization, and hole size. It is known that improving the centralization and widening the annulus not only improves the cement placement success rate, but also brings predicted and actual pumping pressures into better agreement.},

  abstract = {Abstract An understanding of flow along horizontal wells can be important for reservoir management, specially: Tight and shale reservoir. As the completed length in such wells is considerably larger than that in conventional vertical wells, the flow field inside the wellbore can have a significant impact on the overall production characteristics of an oil reservoir. Flow in a well-bore is different from conventional pipe flow due to the presence of wall inflow (as in production wells) or outflow (as in injection wells), and this affects the wall friction, acceleration, and flow patterns inside the pipe. To better understand wellbore flow, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation has been used. A significant advantage of such simulation, besides the fact that they could potentially replace actual experiments, is that they offer a large amount of information on the turbulent velocity and pressure fields, the K-epsilon turbulent model was used to identify the entrance lenth and serve petroleum engineers to locate Pwf inside the horizontal drain for IPR calculation. One of the applications of such information is the development of new techniques in the perforation technology and fracturation of shale and tight reservoir, based upon FLUENT (a commercial CFD software) simulations. Keywords Horizontal well, CFD, Turbulence, Pressure loss, Perforation, Performance, Drain, Completion, wellbore. Introduction: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be described as the use of numerical computing to produce information about the ways in which fluids flow in given situations. CFD techniques have been widely applied in the aerospace, automobile and defence sectors and numerous other industries where describing or simulating fluid flow fields and properties are important. In this report we consider the application of CFD for the description of flow in horizontal oil wells. A horizontal well consists of a long perforated pipe (linear) into which fluid enters through perforations in the wall. The pressure difference between the reservoir and the wellbore liner determines the local production rate.The pressure drop in the well liner is caused by a number of factors: -~ The acceleration pressure gradient due to wall inflow or outflow. -~ The pressure gradient due to inflow direction: Inflow may enhance the axial flow if the inflow angle is less than 90 degrees, whereas it may hinder the axial flow if the inflow angle is greater than 90 degrees. However, under practical flow conditions, the inflow directional effect is negligible. -~ The frictional pressure gradient. - The gravitational pressure gradient (for inclined wellbores). It has been observed that this pressure drop reduces the production as one move from the production end (heel) towards the closed end (toe) of the well. Consequently there is higher production in the heel region of the well as compared with the toe of the well. This can sometimes lead to extreme results, like more than half the production from the first quarter length of the well. Such phenomena reduce the productivity of the well, and hence the flow fields and parameters which affect production in a horizontal well need to be investigated and understood. In this context, the most commonly used models are two equation models called k - Epsilon models [8]. Such models have been extensively tested for industrial pipe flows and other practical applications. These models use the assumption of isotropic turbulent viscosity, even though this is not strictly consistent with the anisotropic nature of the turbulent structure of the flow field. Still, as far as prediction of global parameters like pressure drops is concerned, the two equation models have proven to be adequately robust. If the details of the flow field are desired, these models could still be used with some modifications, but one would then probably need to use the full Reynolds Stress models, albeit at a large increase in computational time.},

The three-layer model of Doron and Barnea (1993) was extended to account for the angle of inclination, which is expected to affect both the pressure drop and the limit deposit velocity. The extended model reproduces satisfactorily new experimental data as well as data of previous investigators. The additional effect of the gravitational force induces higher pressure gradients together with higher limit deposit velocity as the pipe's upward tilt is increased. For downwards inclination, the limit deposit velocity decreases drastically, and the pressure drop is reduced, since for downflow gravitation acts as a driving force},

  abstract = {Pipe roughness is known to greatly increase the turbulent flow friction factor for Newtonian fluids. The well-known Moody diagram shows that an order of magnitude increase in the friction is possible due to the effect of pipe roughness. However, since the classical work of Nikuradse (1926 -1933), very little has been done in this area. In particular, the effects that pipe roughness might have on non-Newtonian turbulent flow head loss, has been all but totally ignored. This thesis is directed at helping to alleviate this problem. An experimental investigation has been implemented in order to quantify the effect that pipe roughness has on non-Newtonian turbulent flow head loss predictions. The Balanced Beam Tube Viscometer(BBTV), developed at the University of Cape Town, has been rebuilt and refined at the Cape Technikon and is being used for research in this field. The BBTV has been fitted with pipes of varying roughness. The roughness of smooth PVC pipes was artificially altered using methods similar to those of Nikuradse. This has enabled the accumulation of flow data in laminar and turbulent flow in pipes that are both hydraulically smooth and rough. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids have been used for the tests. The data has been subjected to analysis using various theories and scaling laws. The strengths and problems associated with each approach are discussed and it is concluded that roughness does have a sigmficant effect on Newtonian as well as non-Newtonlan flow.},

  abstract = {There is a need in the drilling induetry to be able to predict the viscosity of oil muds as a func- tion of temperature and pressure. This paper pree- ents the results of an experimental investigation into invert diesel oil emulsion mud viscosity and how it is affected by downhole conditions. Results are given from tests on diesel oil, brine, Low col- loid oil-brine emulsions, and low colloid mude ranging i!ldensity f̃m! ̃@̃̃ ̃̃̃c It was found that invert oil muds generally behave like Bingham plastics. The plastic viscosity can be normalized with the viscosity of the contin- uous phaae, and can therefore be predicted as a function of temperature and pressure. The yield value is only weakly affected by pressure, while the temperature dependence depends upon the amount of solids and organophillic clay present, and the temperaturefshear history. A method is given to estimate downhoLe plastic viscosity and yield value based based upon surface measured values. Results of example calculation are given which show that the use of variable plastic viscosity in friction pressure loss calculations makea little difference in most cases, and that the calculations are not very dependent upon the baee oil used, whether diesel or one of the leaa toxic oils.},

  title = {Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation of the Solid-Liquid Slurry Flow in a Pipeline},
  url = {http://iwtc.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/137.pdf},
  abstract = {An attempt has been made to develop a generalized slurry flow model using the computational fluid dynamics simulation technique (CFD) to have better insight about the complexity of slurry flow in pipelines. The model is utilized to predict concentration profile, velocity profile and their effect on pressure drop taking the effect of particle size into consideration. At first a two-dimensional model has been developed to understand the influence of the particle drag coefficient with the different conditions. Then, three-dimensional model has been generated to complete understanding and visualization of slurry flow behavior. The two-fluid model based on the Eulerian-Eulerian approach along with a standard k-epsilon turbulence model with mixture properties was used, whereby both the liquid and solid phases are considered as continua. The Eulerian model is the most complex and computationally intensive among the multiphase models. It solves a set of momentum and continuity equations for each phase. Coupling is achieved through the pressure and interphase exchange coefficients. The computational model was mapped on to a commercial (CFD) solver FLUENT 6.3. To evaluate the extent of applicability for the simulated prediction model, it has been compared with experimental data of the pressure gradient. The experimental data comprised water-sand slurry with three different particle sizes (0.2, 0.7 and 1.4 mm) at different concentration (from 5\% to 30\% by volume) within a wide range of flow velocity (from 0.5 to 5 m/s).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of cuttings transport for a two-region system composed of a fluid bed (omega-region) and a stationary bed of drill cuttings, which is considered as a porous medium (eta-region) in the two-phase system. The omega-region is made up of a solid phase (sigma-phase) dispersed in a continuos fluid phase (beta-phase), while the eta-region consists of a stationary solid phase (sigma-phase) and a fluid phase (beta-phase). The volume averaging method was applied in this study. Volume-averaged transport equations were derived for both the fluid bed and the porous medium regions. These equations are based on the non-local form of the volume-averaged momentum transport equation that is valid within the bounded region. Outside this region, the non-local form reduces to the classic volume-averaged transport equation. From these equations, a one-equation model was obtained, and the constraints that the one-equation model must satisfy were applied. For estimating the averaged pressure drop and the averaged velocity, the one-equation model was solved numerically by using the finite-difference technique in the implicit scheme. Numerical results are in agreement with experimental data and theoretical results reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {The only reliable approach open to designers of pipeline systems conveying non-Newtonian slurries in the turbulent flow regime has been large scale pipe tests. This paper addresses this design problem, with particular emphasis on the theoretical modelling of the turbulent flow behaviour of these slurries in pipes. The literature and theory pertinent to the flow of slurries in pipes is examined. A new model for the prediction of the turbulent energy gradient is developed from widely accepted fundamentals. A particle roughness effect has been observed and turbulent flow is modelled using a new roughness Reynolds number to correlate the roughness function. Three test facilities were built for the establishment of a data base of non-Newtonian slurry behaviour - a tube viscometer and two pumped recirculating pipe test rigs. The erperimental investigation covered wide ranges of diameter (5 mm to 200 mm nominal bore), mean pipe velocity (0.1 m/s to 10 m/s), slurry relative density (1.02 to 1.65), volumetric concentration (2\% to 37\%), solids relative density (2.4 to 2.8) and particle size range (d85 = 24 to 120 microns). Turbulent flow predictions using the new turbulent model are accurate and better than previous models, particularly in the rough wall region. The new analysis is based on physical behaviour and contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms involved.},

  title = {Modeling of {{Transient Cuttings Transport}} in {{Underbalanced Drilling}} ({{UBD}})},
  volume = {8},
  abstract = {Underbalanced drilling (UBD) holds several important advantages over conventional drilling technology. These include minimization of formation damage, faster penetration rate, and ability for evaluation of reservoir productivity during the drilling process. As UBD technology matures, it has also been used more and more in different applications. However, many aspects of UBD technology remain poorly understood. The model presented in this paper seeks to understand the mechanisms involved in the transport of cuttings in UBD. The model simulates the transport of drill cuttings in an annulus of arbitrary eccentricity and includes a wide range of transport phenomena, including cuttings deposition and resuspension, formation, and movement of cuttings bed. The model consists of conservation equations for the fluid and cuttings components in the suspension and the cuttings deposit bed. Interaction between the suspension and the cuttings deposit bed, and between the fluid and cuttings components in the suspension, are incorporated. Solution of the model determines the distribution of fluid and cuttings concentration, velocity, fluid pressure, and velocity profile of cuttings deposit bed at different times. The model is used to determine the critical transport velocity for different hydrodynamic conditions. Results from the model agree quite closely, qualitatively, with experimental data obtained from a cuttings transport flow loop at the Technology Research Center of the Japan Natl. Oil Corp. (TRC/JNOC)'s Kashiwazaki Test Field in Japan. These results show the importance of slippage in the formation of the cuttings deposit bed. The model is useful in evaluating the minimum flow rate for effective cuttings removal in UBD},

  abstract = {Distributions of mean axial velocity, axial and tangential turbulence intensities together with friction factor versus Reynolds number (f-Re) data are presented for three non-Newtonian liquids in fully developed laminar, transitional and turbulent flow in an annular geometry in the absence of centrebody rotation. Each of the non-Newtonian fluids was shear thinning and to some extent elastic and one was also thixotropic in character. For comparison purposes, measurements are also reported for a Newtonian fluid. In the case of the Newtonian fluid, a mixture of glucose syrup and water, the f-Re data in both laminar and turbulent flow follow the appropriate relationships for the annular geometry, with a clear demarcation at transition which is confirmed independently by a measured increase in the centre-channel axial turbulence intensities. The measured velocity profiles for laminar flow are in good agreement with those predicted theoretically, whilst the turbulent profiles obey the log-law relationship over much of the mid-channel region and tend to the u + =y + relationship in the immediate vicinity of both walls. For the first non-Newtonian fluid, an aqueous solution of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), good agreement with theoretical predictions for a power-law fluid was observed in the f-Re data in the laminar regime with evidence of drag reduction in turbulent flow. Velocity profiles, determined in two planes, indicate minor circumferential asymmetry in laminar flow. Law-of-the-wall plots for fully turbulent flow indicate an upward shift in the data in the log-law region of the annulus consistent with the drag-reduction behaviour, as also observed in pipe-flow experiments for this fluid (Escudier et al. 1992). In the near-surface regions of both the outer and inner tubes the data again tend towards the u § =y§ relationship. Received:},

The viscosity measurements of the Tylose solutions showed shear-thinning behaviour, and the oscillatory and creep tests measured elastic components of the stress of the order of the minimal detectable values by the rheometer. These low molecular weight polymer solutions delayed transition from the laminar to the turbulent regime and showed drag reductions of half that reported to occur with other low elasticity shear-thinning high molecular aqueous polymer solutions. Near the wall the axial turbulent stress was higher than with water, whereas the two transverse components of turbulence were reduced. This near-wall behaviour is typical of drag reducing fluids based on high molecular weight polymers, but in the core of the pipe the three components of turbulence were higher than for the water flows, especially in the radial and tangential directions.},

  abstract = {This study presents a simplified and accurate procedure for selecting the rheological model which best fits the rheological properties of a given non- Newtonian fluid and introduces five new approaches to correct for tool joint losses from expansion and contraction when hydraulics is calculated. The new approaches are enlargement and contraction (E\&C), equivalent diameter (ED), two different (2IDs), enlargement and contraction plus equivalent diameter (E\&C+ED), and enlargement and contraction plus two different IDs (E\&C+2IDs). In addition to the Newtonian model, seven major non-Newtonian rheological models (Bingham plastic, Power law, API, Herschel-Bulkley, Unified, Robertson and Stiff, and Casson) provide alternatives for selecting the model that most accurately represents the shear-stress/shear-rate relationship for a given non- Newtonian fluid. The project assumes that the model which gives the lowest absolute average percent error (EAAP) between the measured and calculated shear stresses is the best one for a given non-Newtonian fluid. The results are of great importance in achieving correct results for pressure drop and hydraulics calculations and the results are that the API rheological model (RP 13D) provides, in general, the best prediction of rheological behavior for the mud samples considered (EAAP=1.51), followed by the Herschel-Bulkley, Robertson and Stiff, and Unified models. Results also show that corrections with E\&C+2IDs and API hydraulics calculation give a good approximation to measured pump pressure with 9\% of difference between measured and calculated data.},

At the end we present numerical experiments for some non-Newtonian models, comparisons with the Newtonian model and the results for hemodynamic wall parameters; the wall shear stress and the oscillatory shear index.},

  abstract = {In order to determine laminar friction losses of non-Newtonian drilling fluids it is standard practice to utilise a simple rheological model with parameter estimation via explicit solution of the required number of simultaneous equations. This limits the choice of available models and, together with the fitting procedure, frequently results in poor fits. Numerous alternative models have been proposed, but their worth has never been clearly demonstrated. Here we consider the rheological models to form the deterministic part of a stochastic model hence acknowledging that observed data arise from randomness due to the system. Parameter estimates are obtained by nonlinear least squares using data readings from eight standard Fann viscometer settings. Results are presented for 20 rheological models on 414 Fann viscometer data sets that encompass a variety of different drilling fluids. The goodness of fit of the models is assessed by comparing boxplots of the resulting residual mean square values. Several of the alternative models are shown to be consistently capable of excellent shear stress prediction over all of the shear rate range expected during drilling operations. The use of statistical methodology allows us to go beyond mere data relationship estimation: it permits the calculation of confidence intervals and tests of significance of functions of the model parameters, for example equivalent circulating density. The validity of such calculations relies on the extent to which the behaviour of the nonlinear least squares estimates approximates the asymptotic properties of being unbiased, normally distributed and minimum variance estimators. The estimation behaviour of the ‘best' fitting models is analysed and a reparameterised form of the Sisko model is identified as having reasonable behaviour. Thus, despite the small data size, when using this model form the subsequent estimates, confidence intervals and tests of significance of functions of the model parameters can be confidently reported.},

A unique tube viscometer was designed and constructed. It consisted of four pipes, one of stainless steel and three of PVC, linked to an in-line mass-flow meter and equipped with two different ranges of pressure transducers on each pipe. The stainless steel pipe, with an inner diameter of 16 mm, was equipped with a specially designed flow adapter for in-line rheological characterisation using the UVP-PD method. The three PVC pipes with internal diameters of 9 mm, 13 mm and 16 mm served as a tube viscometer for in-line rheological characterisation of the mineral suspensions. Results determined by the UVP-PD method were compared with results obtained by off-line rheometry and in-line tube viscometry. The agreement between the UVP-PD method, tube viscometry and conventional rheometry was found to be good (within 15 \%) for all of the highly concentrated mineral suspensions investigated over a given range of shear rates. This method has been found to have significant potential for the development of new inline rheometer technology for process control within the mining industry.},

In so doing, a new rheological parameter is introduced that provides a consistent link between turbulent and laminar flow calculations and flow regime transition criteria. The approach presented is independent of the form of the rheological model of choice, it makes no assumptions about conduit geometry, can include the presence of a laminar plug flow region, accommodates drillpipe rotation effects and accounts for the effects of annular eccentricity. Simple, explicit and general formulations for approximating pressure losses over measurement while drilling tools and positive displacement motors are also presented to augment the suite of expressions required for comprehensive hydraulic calculation over the circulating system. Furthermore, procedures for establishing realistic bounds of confidence for laminar pressure loss functions are presented, enabling computation of the degree of certainty attributable to such a calculation. This procedure for establishing confidence intervals is applicable to any function requiring fitted parameters, hence it has a broader application potential than just drilling hydraulics. The model demonstrates good agreement with measured data from studies involving drilling fluids flowing in both circular and annular conduits.

Several viscometers have been used to measure the viscosity and API gel strengths of drilling fluids at extreme temperatures and pressures.

A basic idea of the structural properties of the fluids can be obtained through the gel strength tests. However, more complete information on the viscoelastic and yielding nature of these fluids is beyond the reach of such instruments. Using the capabilities of a rheometer equipped with a pressure cell, rheological studies of oil-based muds have been conducted. Tests in the range of 0 – 1000 psi and 80°F – 180°F were conducted.

  abstract = {The research presented in this thesis is concerned with the development of numerical techniques and mathematical models for non-Newtonian fluids and two-phase flows in pipes and channels. Single phase, turbulent flow calculations of non-Newtonian fluids were performed initially. Based on the literature a revised approach to wall modelling is proposed and implemented. The approach uses analytical and experimental analyses of the turbulent boundary layer structure. A comparison with the standard approach is presented. The interaction between turbulence and non-Newtonian behaviour is studied by examining the rate of strain induced by fluctuating components of velocity. The statistical analysis of published DNS data is performed. Fi- nally, a model is proposed where the turbulent rate of strain is determined from turbulence quantities used by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model and used in the calculation of molecular viscosity. For two-phase flow, the solution procedure using periodic boundary conditions was developed under an assumption of a flat interface. The numerical technique was verified by comparing to an analytical result obtained for laminar flow in a channel. An extension to three dimensional flow is performed. With periodic boundary conditions standard turbulence models are applied to two-phase stratified flow. Several models and their corrections for two-phase flow are assessed and a new model is proposed. The numerical studies were carried out primiarily in the open-source code OpenFOAM, but initial attempts were made in commercial packages such as STAR-CD and FLUENT. Experimental data collected from the literature are used to verify the results showing good agreement in pressure drops and phase fractions.},

  url = {http://www.nist.gov/el/fire_research/upload/R0501585.pdf},
  abstract = {Aspirating and compressed-air foam systems often incorporate proportioners designed to draw sufficient rate of foam concentrate into the flowing stream of water. The selection of proportioner’s piping follows from the engineering correlations linking the pressure loss with the flow rate of a concentrate, for specified temperature (usually 20 oC) and pipe size. Unfortunately, reports exist that such correlations may be inaccurate, resulting in the design of underperforming suppression systems. To illustrate the problem, we introduce two correlations, sourced from industry and developed for the same foam concentrate, that describe effective viscosity (mueff) and pressure loss as functions of flow rate and pipe diameter. We then present a methodology to verify the internal consistency of each data set. This methodology includes replotting the curves of the effective viscosity vs the nominal shear rate at the wall (32Q/(piD3)) and also replotting the pressure loss in terms of the stress rate at the wall (tauw) vs the nominal shear rate at the wall. In the laminar regime, for time-independent fluids with no slip at the wall (which is the behaviour displayed by foam concentrates), consistent data sets are characterised by a single curve of mueff vs 32Q/(piD3), and a single curve of tauw vs 32Q/(piD3) in the laminar regime. We demonstrate that neither of the data sets shows internal consistency, and suggest possible errors in data processing that led to the observed discrepancies. Finally, we correct the original data to produce the engineering correlations, which are internally consistent and which are characterised by realistic rheology.},

  title = {Calculation of {{Drillpipe Rotation Effects}} on {{Fluids}} in {{Axial Flow}}: {{An Engineering Approach}}},
  abstract = {The usefulness of drill pipe rotation in drilling and cementation has been debated over the past several years. In recent years, the positive effects of pipe rotation on hole cleaning, particularly in highly-deviated wellbores, has been noted. However, many engineers are unsure of the usefulness of drill pipe rotation because the effect has not been quantified. One reason for this is that the effect of drill pipe rotation on non-Newtonian drilling fluids in annular flow is not a well understood phenomenon. There has been no single, valid method developed to mathematically characterize rotation effects on point velocities for non-Newtonian fluids in axial flow. In this paper, the effect of drill string rotation on axial flow is investigated from a fluid dynamics perspective. Using the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model, calculations for pure laminar flow and rotation are coupled to obtain shear rate characterization across the annulus. Developed first for fluids in concentric flow, these methods will be later expanded to handle the effects of drill pipe rotation in eccentric geometries. Using this method to mathematically characterize the effect of drill string rotation on axial velocity can lead to better understanding of annular flow behavior under normal drilling and circulating conditions. Areas such as hole cleaning in high angle wellbores, rotation speeds necessary to effect good annular cleanup prior to cementing, etc., will find useful application for this mathematical modeling technique. Moreover, in today’s complex wells where a narrow operating window exists between pore pressure and fracture gradients, any improved understanding of factors that change annular pressure drop and velocity patterns can be critical to the success of the drilling operation.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of equivalent circulating density (ECD) and circulating bottom hole pressure (CBHP) are essential components of successful managed pressure drilling operations. Normally, calculated frictional pressure losses do not match actual frictional losses recorded during drilling operations. Discrepancies between calculated and measured pressure losses are more severe in operations where synthetic based drilling fluids are used because synthetic based drilling fluid rheologies vary with changes in downhole conditions. In order to deal with differences between actual and theoretical pressure losses, rheological and volumetric characterization of the fluid under downhole conditions was performed. N-paraffin-based drilling fluid (NPDF) was used in this study. Effects of pressure and temperature under HPHT conditions were determined using a mercury-free PVT cell. The volumetric behavior of the NPDF was compared with the behavior of water-based muds and less toxic mineral oil-based muds. An empirical relation for density as a function of pressure and temperature is introduced. In addition, rheological characterization of the NPDF was conducted using an HPHT rotational viscometer. The rheological model that defines the shear stress - shear rate relation of the drilling fluid used in this study at all pressure and temperature conditions is the Yield Power Law model. The effects of downhole conditions on the rheological parameters consistency index (K), flow behavior index (n) and yield stress (to) are analyzed.},

  abstract = {The history and theory supporting the idea of a universal log law for turbulent wall-bounded flows are briefly reviewed. The original idea of justifying a log law from a constant Reynolds stress layer argument is found to be deficient. By contrast, it is argued that the logarithmic friction law and velocity profiles derived from matching inner and outer profiles for a pipe or channel flow are well-founded and consistent with the data. But for a boundary layer developing along a flat plate it is not, and in fact it is a power law theory that seems logically consistent. Even so, there is evidence for at least an empirical logarithmic fit to the boundary-friction data, which is indistinguishable from the power law solution. The value of kappa approximately 0.38 obtained from a logarithmic curve fit to the boundary-layer velocity data, however, does not appear to be the same as for pipe flow for which 0.43 appears to be the best estimate. Thus, the idea of a universal log law for wall-bounded flows is not supported by either the theory or the data.},

Special care is given to the interphase coupling terms that arise, in order to ensure that they are implemented consistently and that they converge under mesh refinement.

  abstract = {In drilling operations, estimation of pressure drop and cuttings concentration in the annulus is very complex due to the combination of interacting drilling parameters. Over the years, many investigators have developed empirical correlations to determine these parameters, however, the use of these correlations are limited to their experimental data range and setup and cannot be applicable to all cases. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method has been widely accepted as the best technique, not only due to its ability to handle complex multiphase flow problems but also its ability to handle lllllimited number of physical and operational conditions. The present study examines the effects of annular diameter ratio, flow rate (fluid velocity), drill pipe rotation and fluid type on pressure drop and cuttings concentration in eccentric horizontal wellbore using CFD method. The annular diameter ratio varies from 0.64-0.90 with the drillpipe positioned at eccentricity of 0.623 and rotating about its own axis at 80 and 120 rpm. The drilling fluids were modelled using Newtonian and Power-Law fluids. Results show that at diameter ratio of 0.90, pressure drop is very dramatic yet, the amollllt of cuttings transported remained almost constant for all fluid velocities. Experimental pressure drop and cuttings concentration data compared favourably with simulation data with mean percentage error of 0.84 and 12\%, respectively, confirming the validity of the cwrent model.},

In order to improve our understanding of these flows and develop efficient simulation strategies, analysis from first-principles is warranted.This paper presents the development and validation of a direct numerical simulation approach where the flow around individual particles is fully resolved. Based on the recent conser-vative immersed boundary scheme of Meyer et al. (2010), the approach allows for the representation of a large number of moving and colliding objects without requiring a body-fitted grid. Fluid mass is conserved discretely, and momentum is exchanged con- servatively between the fluid and the particles. This approach provides a second order accurate drag force on the particles. It is then validated by comparing the drag coefficient of isolated cylinders and spheres at various Reynolds numbers with theory. The effect of particle packing on drag is also considered, and good agreement is obtained with previous studies for both simple cubic and random particle arrangements. Finally, freely moving particles are simulated, showing a significant departure in drag force with the stationary case.},

  abstract = {The effective removal of drill cuttings from the wellbore is one of the key factors to avoid different drilling problems such as poor ROP, associated cuttings bed formation in the presence of weak mudcakes, embedded cuttings bed formation in the presence of poor quality mudcakes, creation of hole pack-off and pipe sticking problems, significant change in mud properties, increase in the severity of formation damage potential of drilling muds, etc. Poor hole cleaning may also trigger induced loss of circulation, borehole instability, kicks, blowout and other borehole problems due to the direct or indirect consequences of improper hole cleaning. Therefore, an accurate and reliable prediction of hole cleaning efficiency of drilling mud in different drilling condition is an inseparable part of a safe and economic drilling operation. An improved prediction tool could provide the necessary guidelines to take appropriate measures while drilling to avoid drill cuttings associated borehole problems. This paper describes a simple, user friendly and more reliable simulation model to predict the hole cleaning efficiency of drilling mud in different borehole conditions using some critical parameters associated with drilling mud, hole geometry, subsurface condition, and the cuttings properties.},

The coefficients of the model are given as functions of the intensity of the mean strain tensor. The apparent eddy turbulent viscosity, the first and second normal stress differences are presented as function of the shear rate.

  title = {Mechanistic-Based Models for Slug Flow in Vertical Pipes},
  url = {https://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/1073},
  abstract = {Slug flow is one of the most common flow regimes encountered in petroleum, chemical and nuclear industries. This flow regime is characterized by pseudo-periodic occurrence of Taylor bubbles and liquid slugs. The approaches for slug flow modeling include empirical methods, mechanistic methods and numerical methods. Numerical methods involve large amount of computation and therefore not suitable for the application in petroleum industry. In contrast to empirical methods that are limited in the range of application, mechanistic models are more applicable because they capture the essential mechanism of the slug flow regime. However, the mechanistic models require some correlations to obtain closure, which bring unexpected error and need to be improved before getting results matching with experimental data. This project established a computational model to simulate the flowing field around Taylor bubble. Boundary fitted structured grid system is built for the simulation model and the turbulence is accounted for by the low Reynolds-number k-omega model. The previous turbulence model is modified to predict smooth transition from laminar to turbulent flow. To obtain the configuration of the Taylor bubble, circular geometry is assumed at the top of the bubble and Bernoulli equation is applied to estimate the shape of the tail part. The fifth order of polynomial function is used to ensure the convergence of the bubble configuration which has uniform pressure along the interface. Based on the results from the numerical model and previous experimental studies, the currently used mechanistic model is improved to get more accurate prediction for the slug flow in vertical pipes. The improved model is validated by previously reported experimental data. The geometric parameters of slug flow analyzed in this project can provide a basis for studying flow regime transition from slug flow to other flow regimes. The significance of this work is to help us understand more details about slug flow in vertical pipes. The knowledge gained from this work can be used to reestablish existing empirical correlations that are limited to particular conditions but necessary to the mechanistic models. The improvement of mechanistic models can benefit the design of tubing and surface facilities and the determination of artificial-lift methods.},

  abstract = {The objective of this master thesis was to investigate the flow properties of water based drilling fluids, utilizing measurements in both the micro and macro scale. The research was performed on two realistic drilling fluids by the use of a viscometer, a rheometer and a realistic flow loop, where the latter represents the macro scale. The research outcome could possibly improve the understanding of flow behavior in wellbores, and remove uncertainties associated with annular friction. The two fluids utilized in the research was made up with the goal of having equal rheological qualities, when measured with a Fann 35 viscometer. A more thorough examination of the two fluid’s rheology was then executed by using a Anton Paar MCR302 rheometer. The macroscopic properties was researched employing a flow loop, capable of simulating realistic wellbore conditions. The main outcome of this thesis is that even though two fluids appear to have the same rheoligical properties when measured on simple equipment, their fundamental different microscopic structure will exhibit variations when the fluids are utilized in real applications. Due to problems encountered when mixing the fluids, as well as problems with one of the fluids itself, not all intended experiments were conducted. The experiments should be replicated with an emphasis on temperature control, avoiding bubbles and foam, and be conducted within a shorter time period.},

  abstract = {In the current work, we combine a detailed transient multiphase well-flow model and modern estimation techniques into a tool for better representation of flow rates in petroleum wellbores (influx or outflux). Accurate flow rates lead to better well control and reservoir management, which again are important for the improved recovery of oil from existing petroleum fields. To achieve this, it is possible to use the fact that smart wells with multiple zones and laterals are more common, and they may be equipped with permanent instrumentation and control. Many wells have pressure and temperature gauges in each zone, or even distributed temperature sensing with high spatial resolution. Today, accurate flow-rate measurements or accurate estimates for each zone are lacking, and existing tools are often limited to steady-state models with no uncertainty analysis. The estimation technique applied here is the auxiliary-sequen- tial-importance-resampling (ASIR) filter, which has the advantage of being more-robust and -reliable than the traditional particle filter (PF). The ASIR filter is used to tune the output of specific stochastic models of the flow rates. To perform this tuning, we have chosen a jump-type model for the flow rates. These kinds of models are popular within areas such as econometrics and finance. More specifically, the model implies that the flow-rate process changes structure governed by an underlying Markov jump process. Using this type of model makes us capable of capturing not only smooth transitions but also more-abrupt changes of the flow rates. We have applied the methodology on two synthetic studies (involving multiple zones and fluids), and our case studies clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the automatic identification of reservoir voir flow-rate distribution from wellbore measurements.},

  abstract = {A low Reynolds number k-e turbulence model is developed for predicting turbulent wall flows of viscoelastic fluids. The model uses a non-linear molecular viscosity that is affected by the turbulent fluctuations and a new damping function is introduced to account for near-wall effects. This new function was made equal to the eddy viscosity damping function which was derived taking into account viscometric and elastic effects. Flow predictions compare favourably with results from experiments with several viscoelastic fluids, especially the friction factor and the mean velocity. Comparisons of the turbulence kinetic energy are less good, but the model is able to capture the shift of the peak turbulence kinetic energy and rate of dissipation away from the wall, the decrease in those peak values and of the production of k, and the Reynolds shear stress deficit across the pipe. An advantage of the present single-point turbulence closure relative to previous attempts at modelling polymer drag reduction, is the fact that here the input is only the mean velocity and fluid properties and no other modifications of the turbulence model are required to deal with different fluids.

  abstract = {A series of experiments was made in a closed rectangular conduit with bentonite as fine particles and plastic beads as coarse particles. Compared with that in clear water, in bentonite suspensions coarse particles settle more slowly and start moving at a higher flow intensity. Due to the larger threshold velocity and smaller settling velocity, the bed load is smaller and the suspended load is larger. As a result, the total load, consisting of the bed load and the suspended load, is smaller in the low flow intensity region, but larger in the high flow intensity region. The increase of the suspended load favors the tran- sition from dunes to plane bed. So in clay suspension dunes are lower, flatter, and change to plane bed at lower flow intensity. Correspondingly, the form resistance is smaller in clay suspension.},

  abstract = {An understanding of turbulent pipe flow is of extreme importance in engineering. The eddy viscosity concept has been used by many workers to describe fully developed, Newtonian, turbulent pipe flow. A knowledge of the eddy viscosity can then be used to predict mean velocity and temperature profiles (and hence heat transfer coefficients). In addition to the Newtonian case, there are many instances when the turbulent flow of non-Newtonian and drag-reducing fluids are encountered. Although several workers have proposed eddy viscosity expressions for Newtonian pipe flow, few comparative studies are available. Little work has been done to develop eddy viscosity expressions for non-Newtonian and drag-reducing pipe flow. The objective of the present study is to review the expressions that have been proposed for the Newtonian case and demonstrate how these can be extended to non-Newtonian and drag-reducing flows .},

If the Hedstrom number He= pD ro/n greater than 10, then the linear approximation method of Caldwell and Babbitt is invalid for pipe flow data obtained in systems of ordinary engineering interest, and the complete nonlinear form of the pipe flow Bingham plastic equation must be used in determining rheological parameters.},

  abstract = {Deepwater, HTHP and narrow pressure-margin well depend on accurate, real-time knowledge of down hole hydraulics in order to their objectives safely and economically. A comprehensive methodology of calculating hydraulic parameters on the basis of logging data was formulated. It can conduct a real-time calculating and monitoring hydraulic parameters using logging data in the process of drilling. First, according to the problem of non-unified data units and the mode of data sharing, transmission during the well logging data transmission, an integrated new well site software module was developed, which combined the functions of data acquisition, transportation and simulation. This module puts the variability of the well logging equipment, complicity of I/O ports, and specialty of transmission protocol outside the real-time computation module which is efficient and simple. Second, a real-time hydraulic calculation method was established, in which the influence of drilling pipes rotation and annular eccentricity were taken into account. In order to improve the calculation precision, the flow channel both in pipe and annuli was divided into several sections, through which the different diameters of the channels were considered. And in each section the variation of ESD caused by HTHP was considered too. A series of system software for hydraulics calculating and monitoring were developed, which include all common hydraulic model (Herschel-Bulkely, Robertson-Stiff, Four-parameter model and so on). We can not only use this system to calculate hydraulic parameters of bottom hole but also any other position both in annuli and pipe. The application of this system in the Tarim Basin and the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China shows the system can exactly monitoring hydraulic parameters and runs smoothly with convenient operation. Therefore it can be seen this system can be applied to provide more convenient, fast and precise hydraulics parameters monitoring while drilling.},

The model has been developed primarily to simulate the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids in eccentric annuli during drilling and completion operations. Predicted flow rates versus pressure gradient for laminar flow of Newtonian fluids in concentric and eccentric annuli, and Power-law fluids in concentric annuli compare very well with results derived from analytical expressions. Moreover, the predictions for laminar flow of Power-law and Yield-Power law fluids in eccentric annuli are in excellent agreement with numerical and experimental data published in the literature.

  isbn = {1-972952-94-3},
  abstract = {The ability to accurately predict the effect of drill pipe rotation on Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) remains a challenge for those involved in engineering today’s complex wells. In many of these challenging wells (extended-reach drilling, deepwater, HPHT, etc.), the safe drilling window between hole collapse and fracturing is often narrow. Improvement in prediction of the effect of drill pipe rotation speed on ECD would allow better optimization of operational parameters in the drilling process, and hopefully reduce the incidence of operating beyond the safe drilling window. Field ECD measurements made with downhole annular pressure tools at different circulation rates and drill pipe rotation speeds (e.g., ‘fingerprinting’ exercises) were modeled and presented to the industry. The presented results constituted the best-available correlation with direct downhole pressure measurements, but still showed improvement was needed. As a bridge between the earlier complex model and the one discussed in this paper, a simplified correlation was developed to give quick method of calculation of increase in ECD as a function of changing drill pipe rotation speed. Since the development of the simplified correlation, more work has been done to improve modeling accuracy of the data set used earlier. It was found that the reduced accuracy of the earlier complex model was the result of under-prediction of the annular shear rates resulting from the axial and tangential flows that, when coupled together, produce helical flow. In this paper, a new shear rate calculation is used and the increased accuracy of the modeling is shown using the measured field data presented earlier. The improved correlation helps in better understanding circulating pressures incurred while drilling and how they relate to hole cleaning, particle suspension, and wellbore instability.

  abstract = {The design and performance of many operations common to the petroleum industry depend upon the unique properties of a class of materials known as non-Newtonian fluids. The art of measuring and describing these properties, called rheology, has fallen far behind the field application of these fluids in this industry. Empirical methods are still employed although theoretically sound methods of analysis are now available. This paper illustrates a completely general method of analysis of the rheological properties of non-Newtonian fluids which is independent of the type of viscometer employed and also the rheological type of fluid encountered except those of a thixotropic or rheopectic nature. Values of the rheological properties of a fluid obtained using this method of analysis are based upon an absolute scale of measurement, eliminating the necessity of employing arbitrary concepts of the flow properties of non-Newtonian fluids. The fundamental nature of this method of analysis is further demonstrated by evaluating the precision with which measurements have been made of these rheological properties by employing a dimensionless criteria - the Fanning friction factor-Reynolds number correlation.},

Slip velocity correlation's have been developed in the past fifty years and recommendations of proper annular velocities have been suggested in order to prevent slippage of drill cuttings around drill collars and drill bit which in turn lead to regrinding of these cuttings causing a waste of the limited energy available to the drill bit. An average annular velocity of 80-120 ft/min has been seen in the oil industry to satisfy the criteria of the proper well bore cleaning. The variables required in determining the minimum flow rate are: hole diameter, angle of deviation, plastic fluid viscosity, yield point, mud weight, cutting specific gravity and the rate of penetration. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the impact that the various field-controllable parameters have on hole cleaning of deviated, horizontal, and vertical wells along with specific hole cleaning problems which may occur at various hole sizes. Minimizing the cost is the target for hole cleaning, and specifically all the petroleum business groups too. While it is important to know that the significance of drilling fluid in terms of its impact on the success or failure of a drilling operation can be compared to the significance of the blood circulating in our bodies. Basically, drilling fluid is a fluid used to drill boreholes into the earth. Often used while drilling oil and natural gas wells and on exploration drilling rigs, drilling fluids are also used for much simpler boreholes, such as water wells. Liquid drilling fluid is often called drilling mud. The three main categories of drilling fluids are water-based muds (which can be dispersed and non-dispersed), oil-based mud, and gaseous drilling fluid, in which a wide range of gases can be used. The main functions of drilling fluids include providing hydrostatic pressure to prevent formation fluids from entering into the well bore, keeping the drill bit cool and clean during drilling, carrying out drill cuttings, and suspending the drill cuttings while drilling is paused and when the drilling assembly is brought in and out of the hole. The drilling fluid used for a particular job is selected to avoid formation damage and to limit corrosion. To determine optimum drilling fluid properties and flow rates to minimize cuttings bed height and circulation time in high angle and horizontal wells. The method uses empirical models relating the cuttings bed height and the bed erosion time to drilling fluid properties and flow rates. Bed erosion tests have been conducted using cuttings transport ability. Cuttings bed height as a function of time has been investigated by using variable flow rates (200 - 400 gpm) and four different drilling fluid compositions. Experimental results were used together with a non-linear failure analysis program to establish a functional relationship among drilling fluid properties, flow rate, cuttings bed height and the time required to circulate the borehole clean. A numerical example is provided to explain the field application of the method. The sequential calculations involved in determining optimum combination of the Power Law viscosity parameters n and K, and the flow rate to minimize the cuttings bed height and circulation time are also given. Field implementation of the proposed empirical correlations and the new method can aid optimization of circulation practices before tripping, and so reduce the associated risk of non-productive time.},

  abstract = {In this paper we derive an accurate composite friction factor vs. Reynolds number correlation formula for laminar, transition and turbulent flow in smooth pipes. The correlation is given as a rational fraction of rational fractions of power laws which is systematically generated by smoothly connecting linear splines in log-log coordinates with a logistic dose curve algorithm. This kind of correlation seeks the most accurate representation of the data independent of any input from theories arising from the researchers ideas about the underlying fluid mechanics. As such, these correlations provide an objective metric against which observations and other theoretical correlations may be applied. Our correlation is as accurate, or more accurate, than other correlations in the range of Reynolds numbers in which the correlations overlap. However, our formula is not restricted to certain ranges of Reynolds number but instead applies uniformly to all smooth pipe flow data for which data is available. The properties of the classical logistic dose response curve are reviewed and extended to problems described by multiple branches of power laws. This extended method of fitting which leads to rational fractions of power laws is applied to data Marusic and Perry 1995 for the velocity profile in a boundary layer on a flat plate with an adverse pressure gradient, to data of Nikuradse 1932 and McKeon et al. 2004 on friction factors for flow in smooth pipes and to the data of Nikuradse 1933 for effectively smooth pipes.},

  abstract = {Variations in annular geometry, eccentricity, and pipe rotational speed strongly affect pressure loss of a fluid flowing in the narrow annulus of a slimhole well. Due to these factors, accurately calculating and controlling pressures in slimhole wellbores is difficult. Accurate pressure calculations are crucial for safely controlling formation pressures and protecting wellbore integrity. Attempts to model non-Newtonian fluid flow in narrow annuli with high-speed pipe rotation have been hampered by the lack of quality data. The results of numerous annular flow experiments presented herein partially correct this deficit. These results supplement annular pressure data from a 2500-ft slimhole test well and standpipe pressure data from a slimhole exploration well. Sensitive pressure measurements were used to characterize fluid flow in concentric narrow annuli created by a 1.25-in diameter (Dp) steel shaft inside clear acrylic tubes with 1.375-in to 1.75-in inside diameter (Dh). Similar tests were conducted in a fully eccentric annulus formed by the steel shaft inside an acrylic tube with Dh =1.50 in. Maximum shaft rotational speed was 900 rpm and maximum fluid flow rate was 12 gpm. Test fluids included water, glycerin solutions, viscosified clear brines, and several slimhole drilling muds. Models selected from the public domain were used with varying success to calculate results from the hydraulics tests. Simple models typically used by the drilling industry calculated annular pressure loss for non-rotating cases with reasonable accuracy. However, the simple models seldom calculated absolute effects of pipe rotation even though calculated trends correctly match those in measured data. For turbulent flow, annular pressure loss increased with increasing pipe rotation. For lamininar flow, annular pressure loss decreased with increasing pipe rotation. In all cases, annular pressure loss increased with increasing mud rheology and decreased with increasing eccentricity.},

  abstract = {abstract Increasing cuttings bed height is a serious concern during extended-reach well drilling. In order to predict and prevent cuttings bed height increase, it is essential to study how the critical parameters influence the cuttings transport, especially the drill pipe rotation effects on the cuttings transport process. In conventional models for cuttings transport, the dynamic behavior of particles due to drill pipe rotation is neglected or empirically simplified. This paper presents a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD–DEM) approach to simulate the cuttings transport considering the dynamic collision process. The fluid phase is treated as an Eulerian continuum and described by CFD method. The cutting phase is modeled by DEM using a soft sphere approach for the particle collision dynamic. The continuum and dispersed phases are strongly coupled via the interaction forces such as the drag force, lift force and pressure gradient force, which is taken into account in the developed CFD–DEM model. The model takes into account the collisions of cutting–cutting, cutting–drill pipe and cutting–wall. Simulations are carried out for a number of laboratory-scale configurations, showing good agreement with experiment data reported in literature. The numerical simulations show that the drill pipe rotation builds cuttings presented in non-symmetric distribution along the hole and significantly decreases the cutting volume concentration at the medium and high fluid inlet velocities and lower range of drill pipe speeds. There is no additional contribution of drill pipe rotation after reaching a critical speed at high fluid inlet velocities. At low fluid inlet velocities, increasing the drill pipe rotation from 0 to 80 rpm dose not significantly affect the cuttings concentration; although an increase in drill pipe rotation speed from 100 to 120 rpm provided a remarkable improvement. Furthermore, at low inlet fluid velocities and horizontal inclinations up to 401, drill pipe rotation can significantly decrease the cuttings concentration. The effect of drill pipe rotation on decreasing the cuttings concentration is almost negligible at high inlet fluid velocities for any inclination.},

There has been an ongoing debate in the literature on whether true yield stress fluids exist, and even whether the concept is useful. This is mainly due to the experimental difficulties in determining the yield stress. We show that most if not all of these difficulties disappear when a clear distinction is made between two types of yield stress fluids: thixotropic and simple ones. For the former, adequate experimental protocols need to be employed that take into account the time evolution of these materials: ageing and shear rejuvenation. This solves the problem of experimental determination of the yield stress. Also, we show that true yield stress materials indeed exist, and in addition, we account for shear banding that is generically observed in yield stress fluids.},

  abstract = {Drilling fluids containing bentonite and bentonite–lignite as additives exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behavior which can be described well by the three parameter Herschel–Bulkley rheological model. It is shown that determination of these parameters using standard techniques can sometimes provide non-optimal and even unrealistic solutions which could be detrimental to the estimation of hydraulic parameters during drilling. An optimal procedure is proposed whereby the best value of the yield stress is estimated using the Golden Section search methodology while the fluid consistency and fluid behavior indices are determined with linear regression on the transformed rheometric data. The technique yields in many cases results which are as accurate as these obtained by non-linear regression but also gives positive yield stress in cases where numerical schemes give negative yield stress values. It is shown that the impact of the values of the model parameters can be significant for pressure drop estimation but less significant for velocity profile estimation for flow of these fluids in drill pipes and concentric annuli. It is demonstrated that very small differences among the values of the model parameters determined by different techniques can lead to substantial differences in most operational hydraulic parameters in oil-well drilling, particularly pressure drop and apparent viscosity of the fluid at the drilling bit affecting penetration rates, signifying thus the importance of making the best simulation of the rheological behavior of drilling fluids.},

Prediction of the cuttings concentration in the wellbore annulus as a function of operational drilling parameters such as wellbore geometry, pumping rate, drilling fluid rheology and density and maximum drilling rate is very important for optimizing these parameters. This paper describes a simple and more reliable artificial neural network (ANN) method and multiple linear regression (MLR) to predict cuttings concentration during foam drilling operation. This model is applicable for various borehole conditions using some critical parameters associated with foam velocity, foam quality, hole geometry, subsurface condition (pressure and temperature) and pipe rotation. The average absolute percent relative error (AAPE) between the experimental cuttings concentration and ANN model is less than 6\%, and using MLR, AAPE is less than 9\%. A comparison of the ANN and mechanistic model was done. The AAPE values for all datasets in this study were 3.2\%, 8.5\% and 10.3\% for ANN model, MLR model and mechanistic model respectively. The results show high ability of ANN in prediction with respect to statistical methods.},

  abstract = {Solid particles settling in drilling fluids has been one of the major problems in effective removal of drilled cuttings from the bit to the surface for a profitable drilling operation. The drag coefficient and particle Reynolds number has been reproduced experimentally and compared with theoretical work. The drag coefficient is influenced by particle size and shape, surface roughness, wall effects, turbulence intensity, fluid properties as expected. Experiments were conducted using two types of drilling fluids, water and HEC solution of which water represented Newtonian fluid and HEC solution represented Non -Newtonian fluid. The Experiment was conducted using a cylindrical column of 1m to observe the settling rates of these particles in both fluids. Electronic stop watch was used to record the settling rates of these particles. Four cuttings sizes were used in conducting the experiment ranging from 0.055 cm to 0.692 cm with densities ranging from 2.150 g/cm3 to 2.820 g/cm3. The Experiment was conducted at a room temperature of 25o C. The results showed lower Reynolds numbers which fall within the Laminar flow regime and could not produce higher Reynolds numbers to account for the turbulent flow regime due to experimental set up of 1m cylindrical column. The drag coefficient decreased with increasing particle Reynolds number. Lower particles gave higher drag coefficient and lower Reynolds numbers while higher particles gave lower drag coefficient and higher Reynolds numbers in comparison for both Newtonian and Non- Newtonian fluids. The settling velocity of a given particle decreases as the fluid becomes more viscous, therefore the settling rate curve for the viscous fluid shifts downwards as the fluid viscosity increases. Empirical correlations were developed and compared with theoretical and experimental work and it showed satisfactory agreement},

The only factors in the rate of penetration equation which are of importance are the hydraulic functions, i.e. functions of pump flow rate and bit nozzle size. It is shown that the only hydraulic functions which have an in- fluence on rate of penetration are bit hydraulics. and the difference between dynamic mud pressure and pore pressure at the bottom of the well. To be able to es- timate the hydraulic program, unknown con- stants must be determined. Therefore, pre- viously known and new empirical constants of the hydraulic functions have been esti- mated.

Past studies have proposed many empirical correlations to estimate pressure losses and cuttings concentration. However, these developed correlations are limited to their experimental data range and setup, and hence, they cannot be applicable to all cases. CFD methods have the advantages of handling complex multiphase flow problems, as well as, an unlimited number of physical and operational conditions. The present study employs the inhomogeneous (Eulerian-Eulerian) model to simulate a two-phase solid-fluid flow and predict pressure losses and cuttings concentration in eccentric horizontal annuli as a function of varying drilling parameters: fluid velocity, diameter ratio (ratio of inner pipe diameter to outer pipe diameter), inner pipe rotation speed, and fluid type. Experimental data for pressure losses and cuttings concentration from previous literature compared very well with simulation data, confirming the validity of the current model. The study shows how reliable CFD methods can replicate the actual, yet complex oil and gas drilling operations.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2011.05.010},
  abstract = {Gas–solid momentum transfer is a fundamental problem that is characterized by the dependence of nor- malized average fluid–particle force F on solid volume fraction / and the Reynolds number based on the mean slip velocity Rem. In this work we report particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of interphase momentum transfer in flow past fixed random assemblies of monodisperse spheres with finite fluid inertia using a continuum Navier–Stokes solver. This solver is based on a new formulation we refer to as the Particle-resolved Uncontaminated-fluid Reconcilable Immersed Boundary Method (PUReIBM). The principal advantage of this formulation is that the fluid stress at the particle surface is calculated directly from the flow solution (velocity and pressure fields), which when integrated over the surfaces of all particles yields the average fluid–particle force. We demonstrate that PUReIBM is a consistent numerical method to study gas–solid flow because it results in a force density on particle sur- faces that is reconcilable with the averaged two-fluid theory. The numerical convergence and accuracy of PUReIBM are established through a comprehensive suite of validation tests. The normalized average fluid–particle force F is obtained as a function of solid volume fraction / (0.1 6 / 6 0.5) and mean flow Reynolds number Rem (0.01 6 Rem 6 300) for random assemblies of monodisperse spheres. These results extend previously reported results of Hill et al. (2001a,b) to a wider range of /,Rem, and are more accu- rate than those reported by Beetstra et al. (2007). Differences between the drag values obtained from PUReIBM and the drag correlation of Beetstra et al. (2007) are as high as 30\% for Rem in the range 100–300. We take advantage of PUReIBM’s ability to directly calculate the relative contributions of pres- sure and viscous stress to the total fluid–particle force, which is useful in developing drag correlations. Using a scaling argument, Hill et al. (2001b) proposed that the viscous contribution is independent of Rem but the pressure contribution is linear in Rem (for Rem $>$ 50). However, from PUReIBM simulations we find that the viscous contribution is not independent of the mean flow Reynolds number, although the pressure contribution does indeed vary linearly with Rem in accord with the analysis of Hill et al. (2001b). An improved correlation for F in terms of / and Rem is proposed that corrects the existing cor- relations in Rem range 100–300. Since this drag correlation has been inferred from simulations of fixed particle assemblies, it does not include the effect of mobility of the particles. However, the fixed-bed sim- ulation approach is a good approximation for high Stokes number particles, which are encountered in most gas–solid flows. This improved drag correlation can be used in CFD simulations of fluidized beds that solve the average two-fluid equations where the accuracy of the drag law affects the prediction of overall flow behavior.},

  abstract = {Turbulent flow of a Non-Newtonian polymeric fluid through concentric annuli is studied using a 9 m long horizontal flow loop (radius ratio = 0.4). The measurement technique used is Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The solvent Reynolds number is found to vary from 47000 to 66400. Pressure drops are measured and used to detect the onset of transition to turbulence. Measured velocity profiles are found to agree with the universal law of the wall for y + $<$ 11. In the logarithmic region, however, velocity profiles deviate from log law, in a manner consistent with the flow of Newtonian fluids. Reynolds stress is found to be reduced significantly compared to water. The polymer is found to contribute significantly to the total stress close to the solid walls. The radii of maximum velocity are found to be biased toward the inner wall. Results of the turbulence intensity analysis show a slight increase of axial intensities in the buffer layer and especially around the outer wall of the annuli for polymer solutions. Radial velocity fluctuations are suppressed by means of polymer solution. The Root Mean Square (RMS) of vorticity fluctuation in the axial direction is also analyzed revealing a significant reduction of vortical activities as polymer is added to the flow.},

  abstract = {The prediction of pressure losses is very important in many oil-field operations, including drilling, completion, fracturing, acidizing, workover and production. In this study, a utility hydraulic calculation method has been developed that requires as input the raw fluid rehological data and relevant hydraulic parameters. This new method is based on three important developments. First, this paper presents a new and powerful rheological model, named four-parameter model. A brief introduction was given to the determination of rheological parameters. Calculation model for rheological parameters was built based on regression method. Using a variety of data from literature, it is shown that four-parameter model could precise represent the rheogram of the time-independent fluids. Second, a generalized hydraulic calculation model is developed based on power law extension method, which is independent of the form of the rheological model of choice. For laminar flow, pressure drop formula is derived based on characteristic method of pipe flow. And turbulent pressure loss is calculated by semi-empirical formulas. Flow regime determination method is established by quoting generalized flow behavior index. Third, for pressure drop calculation precisely, the approach includes the additional pressure loss due to the effect of tool joints, accommodates drilling pipe rotation effects and accounts for the effects of annular eccentricity. Furthermore, simple, explicit and general formulations for approximation pressure losses over measurement while drilling tools are also presented to augment the suite of expression required for complex hydraulic calculation. The predictions of the developed method have been compared with several sets of experimental hydraulic data from different sources. The tested cases include laminar and turbulent flow of various drilling fluids in both pipe and annular geometry. The generalized hydraulic calculation model is shown to be quite accurate and superior to those obtained by the currently available standard techniques.Introduction Rheological characteristics and flowing law of non-Newtonian fluids are often encountered in the petroleum industry problems. The selection for constitutive equations and determination for rheological parameters are the basic elements for the research on non-Newtonian fluid, which is important for drilling optimization, hydraulic calculation and parameters optimization, etc. The standard API methods for drilling hydraulics assume either a Bingham plastic or power law rheological model, which were presented separately by Bingham (1916) and Ostwald (1925). Herschel \& Bulkley (1926) presented a yield power law model. Then, Zamora (1974), Cementing research section (1983) and Zhan (2000) published their papers to discuss the application of this model. Casson (1957) presented an improved model, which was discussed by Chen (1982), Zhong (1987) and Luo (1996), etc. Robertsion and Stiff (1976) presented a new model for drilling fluid and cement slurry. There were several papers published to discuss this model (Liu 1982, Huang 1982, etc). Bai (1980) presented a new hyperbolic model of yield-pseudoplastic fluids. After Sisko (1985) presented a new rheology model, Bailey \& Peden (1997, 2000) presented the hydraulic calculation procedures of this model. Pilehvari \& Serth (2001) introduced a rational polynomial model and the hydraulic calculation method. These models and the corresponding hydraulic calculations do provide a way for fair estimates of hydraulics for conventional wells using simple drilling fluids. However, nowadays, with many wells drilled deep, slim, or horizontal on shore and off shore using complex mud with unusual behavior, it is necessary to use more powerful rheological models and more rigorous calculation methods.},

To simulate the rheolo- gical behavior of blood at unsteady state, three non-Newtonian constitutive relationships are used to study the wall shear stress.

  doi = {10.2118/71375-MS},
  abstract = {Spacer and wash fluids play an essential role in the cementing of oil and gas wells. They are pumped ahead of the cement to optimize the mud displacement, enable a proper hole cleaning, and obtain a good cement bond at the formation and the casing surfaces. The design of spacer fluids relies on an ensemble of physical and chemical characteristics of the spacer including flow characteristics (rheological properties), the stability of the weighted spacer suspension, and the compatibility with other wellbore fluids. The flow characteristics of spacer fluids are the key to successful cementing. The wellbore fluids pumped in the field usually behave as viscoplastic fluids. The non-Newtonian nature of these fluids must be accurately modeled when determining the flow behavior around a centered or eccentric annulus to accurately determine flow regime and dynamic pressures in the annulus along the entire column of fluid. Turbulent flow is the preferred flow regime for efficient mud removal in the annulus, provided the cleaning fluid is effectively in turbulent flow all around the eccentered annulus. Therefore, a reliable criterion for the critical Reynolds number is needed to properly design the well-cleaning process and determine whether it is feasible to be in turbulent flow. In an effort to better understand the fluid dynamics involved with mud cleaning, we have conducted an experimental study on a series of spacer and model fluids. Axial velocity and relative fluctuation intensity measurements were conducted using three different techniques: (1) ultrasonic Doppler technique, (2) hot film anemometry, and (3) laser Doppler Doppler velocimetry. On the basis of these results, we have been able to fully characterize the laminar-to-turbulent transition and evaluate the pressure drop caused by highly non-Newtonian fluid. The results of this study help us define more reliable estimates of the minimum pump rate that will lead to substantial well-cleaning efficiency, taking into account the rheological behavior of non-Newtonian fluids.

  doi = {10.2118/17242-MS},
  abstract = {The ability to predict accurately the circulating system pressure drop whilst drilling is a prerequisite of drilling optimisation. The quantification of the annular pressure drop is also necessary to calculate the equivalent circulating density of the drilling fluid. With invert emulsion drilling fluids, using 'low toxicity' paraffinic oils, these calculations are complicated by the viscosity changes under downhole conditions. This paper presents data from three separate hole sections where annular and drill string pressures were continuously monitored using Measurement While Drilling (MWD) instrumentation. Readings were taken between 2625 and 14764 ft (800 and 4500m) with mud densities ranging from 9.33 to 11.67 ppg (1120 to 1400 kg/m3). The data are summarised and tabulated with respect to the hole geometry, circulating rates and drilling fluid properties. The derivation of correction factors for the estimation of the drilling fluid rheology at elevated temperatures and pressures is detailed with results of laboratory studies using. HP/HT viscometry. The theoretical pressure drops through the annular and drill string sections, with and without application of the rheology correction factors, are then presented. Two rheological models are employed, the power law with yield stress (Herschel-Bulkley) and the Bingham model. The theoretical pressure drops are compared with the actual values. The application of the rheology correction factors is discussed and the comparative merits of the two models reviewed. Finally the paper discusses the implications of the research to hydraulics planning and identifies critical areas of development required to enhance the predictions.},

The Herschel–Bulkley model was found to correlate well with the behavior of bentonite suspensions. The time evolution of the shear stress at constant shear rates was correlated by the Bird–Leider equation. In order to take into account structural evolution of the suspensions, the rheological law was modified by the introduction of the phenomenological model of Tiu and Boger derived from Moore’s kinetics evolution. It was observed that at short rest times and low shearing conditions, this model describes satisfactorily the time-dependent behavior of the bentonite suspensions. The behavior laws and kinetics evolution were established through the determination of structure destructuration and reorganization rates values. The structure parameters were found to be dependent on the clay concentration, providing evidence that the scale characteristic times of the buildup and breakdown processes are also concentration dependent.},

  url = {http://www.pnl.gov/rpp-wtp/documents/wtp-rpt-175.pdf},
  abstract = {The External Flowsheet Review Team (EFRT) expressed concern about the potential for Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) pipe plugging. Per the review’s executive summary, “Piping that transports slurries will plug unless it is properly designed to minimize this risk. This design approach has not been followed consistently, which will lead to frequent shutdowns due to line plugging.” To evaluate the potential for plugging, critical-velocity tests were performed on several physical simulants to determine if the design approach is conservative. Critical velocity is defined as the point where particles begin to deposit to form a moving bed of particles on the bottom of a straight horizontal pipe during slurry transport operations. The critical velocity depends on the physical properties of the particles, fluid, and system geometry. This report gives the results from critical-velocity testing and provides an indication of slurry stability as a function of fluid rheological properties and transport conditions that are typical of what the plant will see. The experimental results are compared to the WTP design guide on slurry-transport velocity in an effort to confirm minimum waste-velocity and flushing-velocity requirements as established by calculations and critical-velocity correlations in the design guide. The major findings of this testing are as follows: Experimental results indicate that for Newtonian fluids, the design guide is conservative. The design guide is based on the Oroskar and Turian (1980) correlation, a traditional industry-derived equation that focuses on particles larger than 100 ?m in size. Slurry viscosity has a greater effect on particles with a larger surface area to mass ratio, i.e. smaller particles. The increased viscous forces on small particles result in a smaller critical velocities. Since the Hanford slurry particles generally have large surface area to mass ratios, the reliance on such equations in the 24590-WTP-GPG-M-0058, Rev 0 design guide (Hall 2006) is conservative. Additionally, the use of the 95\% percentile particle size as an input to this equation is conservative. The design guide specifies the use of the d95 density, this term is ambiguous and needs clarification in the design guide. Nonetheless, this value is interpreted to mean the density of the d95 particle. This density value is irrelevant for critical velocity calculations. Often this value is unknown, and Equation 1 of the 24590-WTP-GPG-M-0058, Rev 0 design guide (Hall 2006) will be used for design purposes. This equation calculates an average or composite density of all solids in the slurry. However, test results indicate that the use of an average particle density as an input to the equation is not conservative. Particle density has a large influence on the overall critical-velocity result returned by the correlation. The viscosity correlation used in the WTP design guide has been shown to be inaccurate for Hanford waste feed materials. Additionally, the recommendation of a 30\% minimum margin on predictions accounts for the majority of data scatter in the equations. However, to account for engineering margin, an additional increase in the design margin is recommended for application to the WTP. Lastly, the original Oroskar and Turian (1980) equation has been modified with a parameter that accounts for the homogeneous and heterogeneous fractions of the slurry. As explained below, this modification leads to a non-conservative result in some instances. In other instances, the conservatism of the unmodified Oroskar and Turian (1980) correlation for small particles is usually large enough to overcome these non-conservative inputs. The use of the Thomas (1979) correlation in the design guide if applied to non-Newtonian fluids or for very small \& dense particles is not conservative. The design guide returns a non-conservative value from the Thomas (1979) correlation rather than from the conservative Oroskar and Turian (1980) correlation in cases where 100\% of the particles are smaller than 74 ?m or in the presence of yield stress forces. The measured data in this report show that the Thomas (1979) correlation predictions often fall below measured experimental values. The measured deposition velocity values in this report are often greater than the limiting critical velocity predictions. The limiting critical velocity predictions also often fall in unstable flow regions on so-called “stability maps.” For this reason, the limiting critical velocity maynot be conservative. A non-Newtonian deposition-velocity design guide is recommended to be developed for the WTP. Since the WTP expects to process large quantities of non-Newtonian slurries, the existing design guide is recommended to be modified to address such non-Newtonian slurries. A central finding of this testing is that particle deposition in non-Newtonian slurries usually occurs near the flow velocity required to reach turbulent flow. This velocity increases with slurry rheological properties (yield stress and infinite shear viscosity) because of viscous forces that dampen the formation of turbulent eddies. Since the turbulent eddies necessary for particle transport are not present, the particles will settle when the velocity falls below this threshold, called the transitional deposition boundary.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present two new numerical algorithms for updating the equations of motion for a viscoelastic fluid that can be described by the finite extensible nonlinear elastic polymer model with the closure proposed by Peterlin (so called FENE-P model) in a transient calculation. In particular, our algorithms address two difficulties found in earlier formulations. First, the polymer extension, represented by the trace of the conformation tensor, can numerically exceed the finite extensible length causing the restoring spring force to change sign and the calculation to rapidly diverge. In our formulations, we have redefined the conformation tensor so that this possibility no longer exists. Secondly, the conformation tensor must remain symmetric and positive definite at all times for the calculation to remain stable. The accumulation of numerical errors can cause loss of this property, leading to the growth of Hadamard instabilities [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 60 (1995) 53]. We present two matrix decompositions that enable us to construct the conformational tensor in a manner that ensures positive definiteness. Numerical tests of the new algorithms show significant departures from other approaches that rely on filtering to remove the instabilities.},

Conventional approach for SPP calculation is based on a number of simplifying assumptions that cannot be realized in real drilling operation. Hence the conventional approach does not produce SPP estimates with sufficient accuracy. The limitations of conventional approach led to the development of alternative methods for SPP estimation using real time data. In this paper, SPP was estimated by regression models and by instance-based reasoning (IBR) models using real time data collected while drilling a deviated well in the North Sea. These models were developed using mud flow rate and bit measured depth as independent parameters. For the real time data considered in this paper, the IBR models produced much better SPP estimates than the regression models.},

  title = {Enhancing {{Decision Making}} in {{Critical Drilling Operations}}},
  volume = {8},
  abstract = {Many critical tasks in oil operations require cognitive skills for safe and efficient drilling. Oil well drilling is a complex process which frequently is leading to operational problems. One problem is wellbore cleaning. If the root cause of the problem was known, the treatment of the problem could be made more focused and efficient. However, to determine the root cause is difficult in this coupled process. One solution to this challenge is to apply knowledge intensive case based reasoning (KiCBR) methodology. KiCBR is a recent approach to problem solving and decision making where a new problem is solved by finding a set of similar previously solved problems, called cases, and reusing them in the new problem situation. This approach consists of two major parts: hierarchy of the concepts with different relation strength and case based reasoning. Concepts are abstracted to symbolic entities. Through the selected fields, data (real time logs, end of well plan and daily drilling reports, etc) are utilized to provide case data base. In this study, three main root causes were chosen; solids accumulation, problematic formation leading to future well cleaning and problematic formation causing well cleaning problems. This paper presents how to determine the root causes for poor hole cleaning episodes by means of the CBR (Case-Based Reasoning). All the involved parameters in each case were stored in the data base. Whenever an unexpected episode is encountered, highly similar case from the data base will come out for decision making. Furthermore, each case has specific and general lessons for those who are in charge of the operations. The match results were good enough but it needs to be improved through indicators that will reveal main cause more precisely.},

  abstract = {As coiled tubing is presently utilized for a multitude of projects in the field, the necessity of estimating the friction pressure of the working fluids in the reeled portion of the coiled tubing string becomes extremely important. Past authors have shown the significant difference in friction pressure between straightened and reeled coiled tubing. This work discusses the experimental investigation of five different polymeric solutions and one drilling mud in three different coiled tubing sizes. The analysis of the frictional pressure loss data includes the effect of fluid rheology, coiled tubing curvature, and tubing diameter. The intent of the analysis is to arrive at a correlation describing frictional pressure loss behavior of polymer solutions and drilling muds in reeled as well as straightened tubing. The experimental setup includes 3000 ft of 2 3/8 in. reeled tubing, 5000 ft of 1 1/2 in. reeled tubing, and 1500 ft of 1 in. reeled tubing. Straightened sections of tubing are also utilized in the setup for comparison and modelling of data. The experimental results are compared with correlations developed by earlier investigators including Mashelkar, McCann, Ito, and Shah. The analysis of the data led to the development of a new model for polymer solutions and a model for drilling muds. The model for polymer solutions is recommended for power law type, pseudoplastic fluids with a power law index less than one, while the model developed for drilling mud was developed for only one concentration of mud. However, the drilling mud correlation suggests the form that other concentrations of drilling mud may follow.},

The author has developed a transient cuttings transport simulator in previous studies, where the power law model was used as a mud rheological model. In this study, theoretical discussion is made about modification of generalized Reynolds number presented in the constitutive equations of the cuttings transport model to adopt the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model. Then using the modified cuttings transport simulator, the author conducted steady-state simulations of cuttings transport in vertical and horizontal wells to validate the adoption of the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model. The obtained results were （1） cuttings transport was more effective with mud having larger yield stress of the Herschel- Bulkley model and （2） the power law model and the dual power law model in API RP 13D respectively underestimated and overestimated the cuttings transport efficiency and were inadequate models for mud whose rheology was best described by the Herschel-Bulkley model.},

  abstract = {A theoretical foundation of a new simulator for hydraulic cal- culations of mud transport is presented. It is demonstrated that it is possible to design a simulator based on theoretical concepts taken from fluid dynamics. The theory is based on a simple turbulence model, which is calibrated against direct simulations of turbulent flows, and a simple expression for suppression of turbulence at low wall strain-rates. The model predicts turbulent non-Newtonian flows, provided rheology data is available. This is an attractive feature of the model as no general non-Newtonian flow correlations are available in the literature. The output from the model is wall shear stresses and pressure drops, while the most important input is the fluid data, and in particular the fluid rheology and its dependency on pressure and temperature. Due to instabilities caused by the drill-string and variable surface roughness at the contacting walls, it is assumed that the flow is unstable or quasi-turbulent, even for low Reynolds numbers well below 1,000. Also, effects of rotation and heat transport are treated in the same fundamental manner. The effects of rotation are included by solving for the tangential velocity in addition to the axial velocity. It is shown that rotation may have a profound impact on the pressure drop. The suggested methodology is expected to increase the precision of predictions and reduce the costs of lab testing and traditional curve fitting to analytical models. The model is verified against experimental data. For most situations, we obtained good agreement with data, as well as for laminar/turbulent transitional flows. Finally, the paper indicates that traditional Fann readings, using 4 points, are inadequate for an accurate rheology determination. In order to improve the hydraulic model, more focus on rheology data is needed.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the lift-off to equilibrium of a single circular particle in Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids by direct numerical simulation. A particle heavier than the fluid is driven forward on the bottom of a channel by a plane Poiseuille flow. After a certain critical Reynolds number the particle rises from the wall to an equilibrium height at which the buoyant weight just balances the upward thrust from the hydrodynamic force. The aim of the calculation is the determination of the critical lift-off condition and the evolution of the height, velocity and angular velocity of the particle as a function of the pressure gradient and material and geometric parameters. The critical Reynolds number for lift-off is found to be larger for a heavier particle whereas it is lower for a particle in a viscoelastic fluid. A correlation for the critical shear Reynolds number for lift-off is obtained. The equilibrium height increases with the Reynolds number, the fluid elasticity and the slip angular velocity of the particle. Simulations of single particle lift-off at higher Reynolds numbers in a Newtonian fluid done by Choi \& Joseph (2000) but reported here show multiple steady states and hysteresis loops. This is shown by us here to be due to the presence of two turning points of the equilibrium solution.},

The f-Re relationship is often applied when designing pipelines, but it depends on the rheological parameters of the fluid and what definition of non-Newtonian Reynolds number is used. In this work, a database of 586 \&\#196;P \&\#8211; Q points from tests with 10 different sludges of concentration 3.4 to 7.2\% by mass, in 3 test pipe diameters, was established and used to rheologically characterise the sludges as Bingham plastic fluids. Five published definitions of the non-Newtonian Reynolds number were used to create composite power law correlations for the f-Re relationship covering all flow regimes. Pressure gradient predictions based on each correlation were compared and ranked, based on 2 different statistical estimates of error. The correlations using the Metzner-Reed Reynolds number (ReMR) and a Reynolds number proposed by Slatter and Lazarus in 1993 (Re2) yielded the lowest errors in comparison with the experimental values. It is shown that these correlations can be used to predict pressure drop to within \&\#177;20\% for a given sludge concentration and operating condition.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a two-dimensional numerical study of the viscoelastic effects on the sedimentation of particles in the presence of solid walls or another particle. The Navier-Stokes equations coupled with an Oldroyd-B model are solved using a finite-element method with the EVSS formalism, and the particles are moved according to their equations of motion. In a vertical channel filled with a viscoelastic fluid, a particle settling very close to one side wall experiences a repulsion from the wall; a particle farther away from the wall is attracted toward it. Thus a settling particle will approach an eccentric equilibrium position, which depends on the Reynolds and Deborah numbers. Two particles settling one on top of the other attract and form a doublet if their initial separation is not too large. Two particles settling side by side approach each other and the doublet also rotates till the line of centers is aligned with the direction of sedimentation. The particle-particle interactions are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations, while the wall repulsion has not been documented in experiments. The driving force for lateral migrations is shown to correlate with the pressure distribution on the particle's surface. As a rule, viscoelasticity affects the motion of particles by modifying the pressure distribution on their surface. The direct contribution of viscoelastic normal stresses to the force and torque is not important. Keywords:},

For non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated with the Hagen–Poiseuille type equation. In turbulent flow, however, several correlations have been developed for smooth pipes. Many of these correlations are in the form of the Dodge–Metzner equation for flow in smooth pipes. The Dodge–Metzner correlation was developed using carbopol aqueous solution which is not used for oilfield operations. Previous studies on friction factor correlation comparison have been limited to the use of non-Newtonian fluid friction factor equations for smooth pipes neglecting the significant effect of pipe roughness on wellbore hydraulics. Generally, tubulars in oilfield applications have some degree of roughness which results in higher friction pressure than that for smooth pipes of the same size especially for less viscous fluids. A few studies have addressed the effect of roughness on friction pressure loss. In this study, friction factor correlations with relative roughness are compared with experimental measured friction factor data using a statistical approach as the basis for comparison. Further, equivalent diameter definitions for annular flow are evaluated to determine the friction factor–equivalent diameter combination that best describes the experimental data. The objective of this work is to recommend the non-Newtonian friction factor correlation that allows for accurate prediction of frictional pressure losses in rough pipes and annular sections.},

The comparisons of the selected equations with the existing experimental results, which are available in the literature, were expressed through MARE, MRE+, MRE-, RMSE, Ѳ, and S. The statistical comparisons were also carried out using MSC and AIC. The analyses show that the Wilson-Thomas (1985) and Morrison (2013) models are best fit models to the experimental data for the Reynolds number up to 40000. Within this range, both models can be used alternately. But beyond this Re value the discrepancy of the Wilson-Thomas model is higher than the Morrison model. In view of the fact that the Morrison model requires fewer calculations and parameters as well as a single equation is used to compute the friction factor for all flow regimes, it is the authors’ advice to use this model for friction factor estimation for the flow of Bingham fluids in smooth pipes as an alternative to the Moody chart and other implicit formulae.},

  abstract = {The drilling of slimholes, extended reach wells and deepwater wells requires accurate bottomhole
pressure (BHP) predictions because of the small annular clearance, long horizontal departure, and
narrow operating pressure window. The effect of drill string rotation on pressure loss has been
investigated before and the general consensus is that pipe rotation has a positive effect on pressure
drop. In several numerical and theoretical studies, the effect has been found to mainly show the
opposite effect, namely a decrease in pressure drop. Numerical and theoretical approaches to model
the annular flow in eccentric annulus with inner pipe rotation is made especially difficult because of
the inertial effects associated with pipe rotation.
In this thesis, theoretical modeling of the pressure loss in eccentric annulus with pipe rotation has
been conducted. The approach was to use an existing model for concentric boreholes with drill string
rotation and systematically incorporate the effects of eccentricity and acceleration of the flow.
Eccentricity of the annulus was approximated by several sectors of concentric annuli with varying
radii. For the inertial effects, a correlation was developed based upon analysis of published numerical
data on Newtonian and Non-Newtonian flows. The model was programmed into a code, which can
give pressure loss as an output, with flow rate, rotation speed, rheological parameters, annulus size
and eccentricity as inputs.
Simulations with the program were compared with published field and laboratory data. Compared to
a set of data from a study on concentric boreholes with pipe rotation, the results are excellent. In
comparison to numerical data on the calculation of frictional pressure loss of Newtonian and Power-
Law fluids, the results are satisfying. The model captures the pressure loss trends of measured
experimental data well. The new model is recommended for field use due to its simplicity and fast
calculations.},

Perhaps the most widely accepted and quoted of these formulae is that due to Dodge and Metzner (2) which is also stated to be rigorous. Some consideration is given to the Dodge-Metzner equation which seems to show that far from being rigorous it is not valid for real fluids. Moreover the formula of Bowen (1), which is the exceptional case not requiring laminar flow data, gives superior correlations and is, therefore, to be preferred. Using a diameter independence hypothesis and Bowen's formula it is possible to find an expression for the turbulent velocity profile. This is checked indirectly by comparing the theoretical and experi- mental friction factors. In a number of cases (but not all) the comparison is favourable.},

The turbulence models studied are (1) three high-Reynolds-number k-epsilon models, (2) six low-Reynolds-number k-epsilon models, (3) two k-omega models, and (4) the Reynolds stress model. The simulation results indicate that the Chang-Hsieh-Chen version of the low-Reynolds-number k-epsilon model performs better than the other models in predicting the frictional pressure drops while the standard k-omega model has an acceptable accuracy and a low computing cost. In the model applications, CFD simulation of mixing in a full-scale anaerobic digester with pumped circulation is performed to propose an improvement in the effective mixing standards recommended by the U.S. EPA based on the effect of rheology on the flow fields. Characterization of the velocity gradient is conducted to quantify the growth or breakage of an assumed floc size. Placement of two discharge nozzles in the digester is analyzed to show that spacing two nozzles 180° apart with each one discharging at an angle of 45° off the wall is the most efficient. Moreover, the similarity rules of geometry and mixing energy are checked for scaling up the digester.},

  abstract = {Ree and Eyring have presented recently a generalized theory of flow by means of which they were able to represent satisfactorily the viscosity of solid plastic systems and polymer solutions (1, 2). However, in view of the complexity of the systems considered and the lack of extensive sys- tematic data, they could not explore in greater detail all the implications of the theory, nor could they rely exclusively on the theory for evaluation of all the quantities involved. At about the same time Maron and Fok (3) completed an extended in- vestigation of the flow behavior of X-667 synthetic latex, which is an aqueous suspension of spherical particles of butadiene-styrene copolymer, stabilized by adsorbed potassium oleate. In this study the average particle size of the disperse phase was measured, and the effects of the following variables were determined: Shear stress from 50 to 800 dynes/cm.̃; con- centration from 0 to 0.60 Volume fraction, v; and temperature from 20 ° to 50°C. Further, the latex flow was found to be Newtonian below ca. v = 0.25, and non-Newtonian above this concentration. These extensive data on the X-667 latex lend themselves particularly well to a detailed test of the generalized flow theory of Ree and Eyring, as well as to an examination of the concentration and temperature de- pendence of the parameters involved. The results of this investigation are presented in the present paper. THEORETICAL},

  abstract = {The Casson model and the Robertson–Stiff model have been used to determine whether they can describe the rheology of aqueous bentonite suspensions. The assessment utilized a total of twelve sets of experimental viscometric data from literature and from this work. Equations have been presented which allowed the determination of the true shear rates experienced by the fluids within the gap of the rotational viscometer for both rheological models. Non-linear regression has been applied to determine the two rheological parameters for the Casson model and the three rheological parameters for the Robertson–Stiff model using true shear rates and Newtonian shear rates, which are used most often in the analysis of rheometric data. The results showed that both models describe well the experimental data of these bentonite suspensions with good statistical indicators. Furthermore, analysis showed that true shear rates are always higher than Newtonian shear rates for both models. The differences depend on the particular suspension and are larger at low shear rates while they become smaller at higher shear rates indicating that the fluid behavior approaches Newtonian behavior at higher shear rates. The shapes of the rheograms remained essentially unchanged indicating that the rheological parameters determined with the use of true shear rates are very similar to the rheological parameters determined with the use of Newtonian shear rates. This was further confirmed with the computation of the rheological parameters for both models and both approaches. For the Casson model differences in the yield value computed with true shear rates were at most at 7\% while for the plastic viscosity at 3\%. For the Robertson–Stiff model, differences of the order of 2 to 5\% were observed for the K-values, of 7\% for gamma˙0-values while no differences were observed for the n-values. These small differences, however, do not justify use of Newtonian shear rates when analytical solutions exist which allow use of true shear rates without any compromise.},

As clay concentration increased to 25 and 28 g / 350 ml at 10\% sodium carbonate concentration, an additional increase in shear stress of 32 and 29\% was observed respectively.

  title = {Turbulence {{Modeling}} for {{Engineering Flows}}},
  url = {http://www.ansys.com//staticassets/ANSYS/staticassets/resourcelibrary/techbrief/tp-turbulence-modeling-for-engineering-flows.pdf},
  abstract = {Turbulence is arguably the most challenging area in fluid dynamics and the most limiting factor in accurate computer simulation of engineering flows. It constitutes a classical multi-scale problem, which is far beyond human intuitive understanding and beyond resolution capabilities of even the most powerful modern parallel computers (for any foreseeable future). Turbulence has been described by Nobel-prize winning physicist Richard Feynman as the “most important unresolved problem in classical physics.” An even more pronounced quote is associated to Werner Heisenberg: “When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: Why relativity? And why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.” From a more pragmatic standpoint, however, one could argue that a complete understanding of turbulence is not required (and there is actually no indication that humans can comprehend complex nonlinear problems), but a sufficiently accurate solution of the underlying equations (better, a general method for achieving those) would suffice. Such numerical methods exist and allow a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Navier–Stokes equations for all turbulence scales in space and time. However, due to the inherent scaling laws of turbulence, DNS can be applied only to very low Reynolds (Re) numbers and very simple and limited geometries. The numerical effort for DNS scales with Re3, and with technical Re numbers in the range of 104 to 109, practically no numerical solution for flows of interest to engineers can be obtained. Turbulence modeling is the attempt to develop approximate formulations that, despite our incomplete understanding and limited computational resources, allow engineers to obtain approximate solutions for their pressing technological applications. When dealing with turbulence models, keep in mind that they often need to bridge a gap of many orders of magnitude in computing power relative to DNS. The order of CPU reduction of RANS methods relative to DNS for technical applications is astronomic (easily reaching 1010 and more) — such models, therefore, are not simply “models,” but they alter and redefine the equations solved. Industrial users are often (understandably) disturbed by RANS-related inaccuracies in their CFD solution relative to data. Considering the above challenge, such differences cannot always be avoided. Finally, not all differences between numerical results and experimental data are automatically a result of turbulence modeling; there are many other sources of error (for example, Roache 1989) that should be considered before casting a judgment on a model. Industrial CFD codes have to cover a wide range of applications from aerodynamics to internal flows, flows with heat and mass transfer to inherently unsteady applications. There are numerous areas of turbulence interaction with other physical effects, like combustion or acoustics. Obviously, no single model (or modeling approach) can cover all such applications, and numerous modeling concepts need to be developed. On the other hand, it would not be appropriate to simply program an indiscriminate number of models into industrial CFD codes, as it would have severe negative effects on the user community. The first is that most models published are not “industrialstrength,” meaning they have severe weaknesses that prevent efficient use for complex problems. The most prominent limitation is numerical robustness, as many new models are applied only to generic test cases with relatively simple geometries and high-quality grids. When faced with less-optimal conditions, they often pose severe challenges to the solver and, in many cases, lead to numerical instabilities. Most models based on the low-Re epsilon-equations fall into this category. Furthermore, models often feature many complex nonlinear terms, which are designed to resolve a very specific problem in generic tests, but the side effects of such terms in complex flows are not sufficiently considered. From a coding standpoint, it is desirable to limit the number of models, as otherwise implementation quality will suffer and the user cannot rely on the correct and optimal programming of equations. Support teams need to understand turbulence models to ensure proper response to customer problems in a short timeframe. An oversupply of models severely limits the engineering team’s ability to properly help customers and supply best-practice advice. Finally, the different models and submodels have to work properly in combination (for example, turbulence and transition, etc.). For these reasons, it is necessary to provide a limited number of preselected models that are: • Well understood and tested • Correctly implemented and documented • Accurate for certain classes of flows • Robust even for nonoptimal grids • Interoperable with other models and submodels • Supported by test cases The interplay of technology and implementation aspects becomes even more pronounced for scale-resolving simulation (SRS) methods like scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) (Menter and Egorov 2010, Egorov et al. 2010), detached eddy simulation (DES) (Spalart 2000, Spalart et al. 2006, Strelets 2001), or large eddy simulation (LES) (Smagorinsky 1963), in which the numerical scheme has a direct impact on model accuracy. For such models, it has to be assured that the numerical method selected matches accuracy requirements of the underlying turbulence model. This paper focuses on the industrial formulation and application of turbulence models. These notes, therefore, do not attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of turbulence modeling theory; instead, they outline the current status of models used in industrial codes as well as methods with potential for the next generation of industrial applications. The material is closely aligned with the author’s line of work. For basic coverage of turbulence modeling, refer to textbooks such as Durbin and Reif (2001) or Wilcox (2006).},

  abstract = {The rheology study of drilling fluid is important to understand the performance of drilling fluid to efficiently remove, transport and suspend cuttings, to maintain a stable wellbore and minimize mud pump requirements. Drilling fluid rheology is often maintained at required rheology standards through the use of additives or dilution depending on the needs of the operation. In this project, a rheology modifier named VisPlus is added into the drilling fluid to improve drilling fluid rheology. The objectives of this project is to study the rheology of invert emulsion drilling fluid or invert oil drilling fluid, which is a type of oil-based drilling fluid (OBM) using different concentrations of the rheology modifier, VisPlus. The rheology of drilling fluid with different concentrations of VisPlus were analyzed and compared against rheological requirements. This rheology study also includes the correlation of the experimental results against three rheological models namely Herschel-Bulkley, Casson and Power Law. From the correlation results, the most rheological model to predict drilling fluid rheology is the Herschel-Bulkley Rheological model.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulation of the weakly turbulent flow of non-Newtonian fluids is undertaken for two different generalised Newtonian rheology models using a spectral element Fourier method. Results for a power law (shear- thinning) rheology agree well with experimentally determined logarithmic layer correlations and with other previously published experimental work. As the flow index becomes smaller for the same Reynolds number, the flow deviates further from the Newtonian profile and the results suggest that transition is delayed. Predicted friction factors fall above those in the literature, but below the Newtonian values indicating that shear thinning behaviour alone can result in drag reduction. Results for a Herschel-Bulkley model (yield stress + shear-thinning) are compared to corresponding experimental measurements and found to be in good agreement. Use of this DNS technique shows great promise in understanding transition and turbulence in non-Newtonian fluids.},

  abstract = {Pressure gradients were measured for shear-thinning (5\% CMC), Bingham plastic (7\% bentonite), and viscoplastic (6\% kaolin) fluids in pipe diameters of 40 to 200 mm, in laminar and turbulent flow. The fluids were characterized as power law, Bingham plastic, and Herschel-Bulkley fluids respectively, and additionally as Casson fluids. The study considered the effect of the rheological model in repro- ducing experimental laminar flow, and on transitional velocity and turbulent flow predictions. For the fluids tested, the model was found to have little effect on laminar flow calculations. Transitional velocities were predicted using three well-known techniques and found to depend on the model, although no preferences were apparent. Errors in transitional velocity predictions varied from 2.5 to 31\%. Turbulent predictions too were made using three common and widely published methods, and varied significantly with rheology. All the methods, however, predicted turbulent flow similarly when using the Casson model, with errors of between 4 and 11\%. It is concluded, at least for the types of time-independent, homogeneous/pseudohomogeneous, non-Newtonian fluids investigated, that for pipe flow in the practical range 40 s−1 $<$ ð8V=DÞ $<$ 1,000 s−1, laminar flow pressure gradient predictions are insensitive to the rheological model. Transitional velocity and turbulent flow pressure gradient predictions, however, are significantly affected by the rheological model used, so care must be taken to correctly characterize fluids for which these predictions are required.},

  abstract = {In many situations, hydraulic transport is considered a competitive means of solids transportation because it can bring several advantages. Compared to a mechanical transport, the hydraulic transport is dust free, demands less labor, and enables full automation for operation. So, it may be one of the most economic and safe transport methods. To keep hydraulic transport economically attractive, it is required to transport slurries at high solids concentrations. Therefore it is required to have enough information on the flow behavior of dense slurries in pipelines. For homogeneous slurries, when increasing the solids content the mixture can behave as non- Newtonian fluids. The aim of this paper is experimentally investigate the flow characteristics of homogeneous slurries that showed non- Newtonian behavior. So, the experimental measurements of kaolin slurries in a pipeline test loop have been studied and compared with the theoretical predictive approaches. The slurry volumetric concentrations ranged from Cv = 2.8\% to 22.6\%. Both laminar and turbulent flow regime were obtained.},

Rheological measurements using a Bohlin CS 50 rheometer and a model 35 Fann viscometer showed that these fluids exhibit shear thin- ning and thermal thinning behavior except the bentonite drilling mud whose viscosity increased as the temperature was raised. Flow experiments using a full-scale coiled tubing test facility showed that the friction pressure loss in coiled tubing is significantly higher than in straight tubing. Since the polymeric fluids displayed drag reducing prop- erty, their drag reduction behavior in straight and coiled tubings was analyzed and compared. Plots of drag reduction vs. generalized Reynolds number indicate that the drag reduction in coiled tubing was not affected by polymer concentration as much as in straight tubing. The onsets of turbulence and drag reduction in coiled tubing were sig- nificantly delayed as compared with straight tubing. The effect of solids content on the friction pressure losses in coiled tubing is also briefly discussed.},

The paper focuses on ECD fluctuation occurred while repeated formation and erosion of cuttings deposit bed in drilling ERW. Numerical studies of hydraulics calculation were carried out in combination with cuttings transport model along the whole trajectory of ERW. While the cause of ECD fluctuation is primarily thought to be the mud pumps being turned on and off, our calculations showed that repeated formation and erosion of cuttings deposit bed, due to the repetition of drilling and drilling interruption for making a connection, causes a significant level of irregular fluctuation of ECD. To avoid severe unexpected ECD fluctuation in drilling ERW, the authors recommend that the schedule of mud circulation operations for hole cleaning and ROP management should be carefully designed by hydraulics calculations in consideration of transient behavior of cuttings transport.

Simulation is performed to calculate the parameters such as pressure, volume fraction and velocities of two phases at different flow regimes, namely bubbly, slug and churn turbulent flow. The governing equations along with appropriate constitutive relations form a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which are solved using the well-known iterative Newton method. The effect of gas and liquid injection flow rates and also the choke pressure on the wellbore pressures, particularly on the BHP are investigated numerically. In order to validate the results of the current two-fluid model, they are compared with the actual field data and also with the results of the WELLFLO software using different mechanistic models. The comparisons show that the two-fluid model can accurately predict the BHP and other two-phase flow parameters.},

The most successful model is one proposed by Krieger and Dougherty for Newtonian viscosities,eta (ϕ, ϕ M ), but withϕ M varying from a low-shear limitϕ M0 to a high-shear limitϕ M∞.

First we will show that the particle moves towards a wall if immersed in a non-Newtonian fluid under continuous shear flow, in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. Anyway most of the experiments are performed under oscillatory shear flow, so we will study the effect of oscillation on the migration of the particle and we will compare our results with experimental data. Finally we will report results of migration when particle is moving between two concentric rotating cylinders.

Two–way coupling was used to explain the effect of the particles on the turbulence. The results showed that the vortex has a great influence on the particle distribution. Most of the particles aggregate at the centre of the channel. Particle clusters along the vortex circumference modulate the development of the vortex. The turbulence modulations showed anisotropy.

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the prediction of critical conditions for the behaviour of particles in simulated oil-drilling fluids. In practice, the rheology of many oil-drilling fluids can be represented adequately by a power-law model and the behaviour of spherical particles can give valuable information on the behaviour of less regularly shaped particles. In this paper, the flow of a power-law fluid past a single sphere located on the axis of a cylindrical pipe is simulated numerically. Two different regimes are considered. In the settling regime, the spherical particle moves through a quiescent fluid. For this regime, drag coefficients for a wide range of power-law indices and particle Reynolds numbers are computed. Power-law indices range from n = 0.4 to n = 1 and Reynolds numbers (based upon the radius of the sphere and the settling velocity) are in the range 0.2 ⩽ Rep ⩽ 100 for sphere/cylinder diameter ratios of and . An expression is proposed which determines the drag coefficient in power-law fluids as a function of power-law index n and particle Reynolds number Rep. Numerical results are compared with both experimental results and other published numerical results. In the transport regime, the fluid is in motion relative to the pipe and the sphere, so that the fluid in the cylinder is sheared. Drag coefficients in the mid-Reynolds-number range for the transport regime are compared with those obtained in the settling regime. Finally, the numerical results have been presented in the form of two graphs which can be used to predict velocities of particles settling in power-law fluids and also to predict the maximum-sized particle which can be transported upwards by the flow of a power-law fluid.},

The accuracy of the proposed equation was checked statistically and by measured and field-calculated data. Turbulent pressure loss due to friction in any pipeline can be calculated only if the friction factor is first determined. Determining this factor poses a significant problem for a pipeline engineer designing for non-Newtonian fluids because of the large number of friction-factor equations available in the literature. The present research work set out to compare among the different friction-factor equations and propose an accurate one. The results led to proposal of a regression equation for calculating the friction factor based on the available measured data.},

The rotation of the drillpipe, and hydraulic and rheological parameters, are the key factors for wellbore cleaning. In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is applied to simulate solid-liquid two-phase flows in wellbore annulus. The annual flow field with the presence of drillpipe rotation is described through analyzing various rotation conditions. The results indicate that the quasi-spiral flow is the main flow pattern for liquid-solid transport in the horizontal annulus. The influence of rotation on the cuttings transport is also investigated, as the rotation of drillpipe increases the disturbance of liquid to solid in annulus. As a result, the solid flow becomes favorable and the solid volume is reduced. Comparisons with previously published results are also performed to prove the importance of drillpipe rotation in the wellbore clearing for the ERD.},

The filtered conformation tensor equation involves deconvolution for stretching and for the nonlinear spring force, as well as secondary regularization. Results are shown at a friction Reynolds number 180 for Weissenberg numbers and molecular extensibilities spanning the moderate to high drag reducing regimes. Excellent agreement is obtained between TLES and direct numerical simulations (DNS) in terms of percent drag reduction prediction. TLES is also able to reproduce the high level of anisotropy of turbulence, which confirms recent findings by Frohnapfel et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 577, 457 (2007)] who present high anisotropy as a general mechanism to obtain significant drag reduction.

  abstract = {Drilling fluids are time-dependent and exhibit viscoelastic behaviour; i.e., they exhibit both viscous and elastic responses under deformation. Viscoelastic properties of drilling fluids are very important to evaluate gel structure, gel strength, barite sag, hydraulic modelling, and solid suspension. However, elastic properties are still not being properly accounted for in rheological characterization. This study seeks to investigate quantitatively the viscoelastic properties of oil-based drilling fluids and the application of viscoelastic data in drilling operations. Standard test procedures were designed to measure viscoelastic properties of fifteen oil-based drilling fluids within the linear viscoelastic range. Experiments were performed using an Anton Paar Physica MCR 301 Rheometer. Periodic oscillatory tests were conducted to investigate material functions of fluids, evaluate gel strength, and time and temperature dependence. In oscillatory testing, amplitude sweep tests were used for determining the linear viscoelastic range, and detecting structural stability, gel strength and dynamic yield point. Frequency sweep tests were conducted to obtain storage modulus, loss modulus, complex viscosity and loss tangent. Temperature sweep tests were conducted in the temperature range from 4 to 80oC to obtain the temperature dependence on the internal gel structure of samples. Oscillatory time sweep tests were used to investigate the change and the stability of the structure of the drilling fluids as a function of time and temperature. The gelling time and gelling speed are calculated from time sweep tests. Experimental results are analyzed to evaluate the viscoelasticity of the samples. The results show that the tested fluids exhibit viscoelastic properties and the viscoelasticity of the samples strongly depends on temperature and gelling time. Further, the Cox-Merz rule, an empirical relationship between dynamic and steady-state viscosities, is very useful to estimate steady-state viscosity from complex viscosity and vice versa. It provides valuable information in the structure build-up during steady shear flow. However, data analysis confirms that the tested samples do not obey the Cox-Merz rule. The departure from the Cox-Merz rule of the tested samples is an indication of structural heterogeneities and weak structure build-up; this can be attributed to fluid structure decay. The extended Cox-Merz rule is proposed to correlate steady-state and dynamic viscosities. The Time-Temperature Superposition Principle was validated to be inapplicable for tested drilling fluids. Frequency sweep data (storage modulus and loss modulus) at different temperatures are not superimposed when shifted to a reference temperature. The results of this study provide quantitative information about the dynamic properties of drilling fluids. These give useful insight into the structure, stability, and time and temperature dependence of drilling fluids. The data can be used to evaluate static barite sag, cuttings transport and suspension, and hydraulic modelling and optimization.},

Experimental data were taken from Gilles et al. (2004), Roco et al.

Two CFD models available in STAR-CCM+ for Eulerian multiphase flows were used, the simple solid pressure model that uses the exponential formula for the solid pressure force and more sophisticated model based on the kinetic theory of granular flows that takes into account bulk, collisional, kinetic and frictional viscosities, which result from the presence of solid particles. In both models the turbulent flow was modelled using the standard k- model. The drag force acting on the particles was modelled using the Gidaspow formula. The granular flow model was compared with the DEM implemented in STAR-CCM+. The DEM formulation used in STAR-CCM+ is based on the soft-particle formulation where particles are allowed to develop an overlap. The non-slip Hertz-Mindlin contact model was used to account for particle-particle interactions and the Gidaspow drag formula for liquid-particle interaction. CFD and DEM predictions of solids concentration were compared against experimental data. The comparisons were made in terms of accuracy and computational time.},

  abstract = {In this paper the turbulent flow characteristics of viscoelastic fluids are investi- gated quantitatively. The outstanding property of these flow fields is seen to be a very pronounced suppression of turbulence, accompanied by major reductions in the turbulent drag coefficients. Careful measurements of the rheological properties of the several fluids used suggest that the observed turbulence sup- pression is a function of the ratio of the elastic to the viscous forces developed in the fluid. An empirical correlation of the results, based upon this observation, is proposed; the present data, while indicative, are not sufficiently extensive to verify conclusively the existence of a quantitative correlation. In a number of respects, the observed reduction in drag is similar to that which may be obtained through promotion of ‘slip’ at the tube wall or by addition of particulate matter. It is shown that slip phenomena are clearly distinct from those studied in the present work but that particulate effects (albeit of much greater magnitude than observed heretofore) cannot be ruled out as contributory mechanisms. Further studies are thus required to determine the relative im- portance of continuum (viscoelastic) and particulate effects.},

The accuracy of the new method is quantified using the zero pressure gradient 2-D turbulent boundary layer data of Österlund for which independent measurement of wall shear is available. Results show that the new procedure can provide accurate estimates of wall shear with a mean error of about two percent or better. The usefulness of this method is in its ability to provide accurate estimates of wall shear not only based on full velocity profile data but also sparse data points in the velocity profile, including only a single data point.},

Pressure losses and skin friction coef- ficients are measured for fully developed flows of water and a 0.4\% aqueous solution of sodium car- boxymethyl cellulose (CMC), when the inner cylinder rotates at the speed of 0̃62.82 rad/s. The transitional flow has been examined by the measurement of pressure losses to reveal the relation between the Reynolds and Rossby numbers and the skin friction coefficients. The effect of rotation on the skin friction coefficient is largely changed in accordance with the axial fluid flow, from laminar to turbulent flow. In all flow regimes, the skin friction coefficient increases due to inner cylinder rotation. The change of skin friction coefficient corresponding to the variation of rotating speed is large for the laminar flow regime, becomes smaller as the Reynolds number increases for the transitional flow regime, and gradually approaches zero for the turbulent flow regime. The value of skin friction coefficient for a radii ratio of 0.52 is about two times larger than for a radii ratio of 0.9. For 0.4\% CMC solution, the value of skin friction coefficient for a radii ratio of 0.52 is about four times larger than for a radii ratio of 0.9.},

High-temperature drilling fluid systems (HTDFS) which are most commonly used in the Mexican geothermal well drilling industry were selected and evaluated. Eleven water-based drilling fluids were formulated and chemically characterized in order to carry out the rheological evaluation. Dynamic experimental tests considering the non-Newtonian behaviour of such HTDFS were performed using a coaxial cylinder-type viscometer (Fann 50C). Drilling fluid viscosities in a programmed temperature range of 25-180 °C (at a constant reservoir pressure and a shear rate of 3448.2 kPa and 170 s-1, respectively) were measured. These dynamic viscosity measurements were then fitted to derive correlating equations for determining the drilling fluid viscosity as a function of temperature. Details of the experimental rheological tests including a complete description of the equipment and all the HTDFS used as well as the derived viscosity-temperature equations are presented.},

This is evident in everyday tasks such as squeezing toothpaste from a tube or dispensing ketchup from a bottle, but is important across a whole range of industries and applications. The determination of a yield stress as a true material constant can be diffi cult as the measured value can be very much dependent on the measurement technique employed and the conditions of the test, of which there are many. Consequently, there is no universal method for determining yield stress and there exist a number of approaches, which find favour across different industries and establishments. This White Paper discusses the various approaches available to measure yield stress, and aspects of the practical measurement set-up and test parameters that need to be considered to obtain relevant, robust and reliable yield stress data using a rotational rheometer.},

The overall program entails the development of enhanced well modeling and general simulation capabilities. The development and features of a new general purpose research simulator (GPRS) are described. The simulator accommodates varying degrees of solution implicitness, handles structured and unstructured grids, and can additionally be used for modeling fractured reservoirs. Advanced linear solution techniques were also implemented. A general gridding and upscaling procedure for unstructured models is presented. The method includes a streamline simulation technique that can be used to assess the accuracy of the coarse model. A semianalytical technique for the modeling of nonconventional wells was developed. This model, implemented into an advanced well modeling software package (AdWell), provides an approximate treatment of reservoir heterogeneity and is able to model downhole inflow control devices and wellbore pressure losses. The well index, which is a key parameter in finite difference well models, can also be computed from AdWell. A drift-flux model for the description of multiphase wellbore flow is presented. Parameters applicable for use in practical systems are determined through tuning to unique experimental data (obtained outside of this DOE sponsored research) on large- diameter pipes. The optimum deployment of nonconventional wells is considered next. A genetic algorithm for determining the optimum well type and location is described. A technique for the optimization of smart well control is then presented. The linkage of the method with a history- matching procedure provides a prototype real-time well control strategy.},

  abstract = {The handling of solid-liquid suspensions is an important concern within the chemical and processing industries and many theoretical models have been proposed to try and explain and predict turbulent flow behaviour. However, the prediction of turbulent flow from only the viscous properties of non-Newtonian suspensions has over the years been questioned by researchers. This thesis considers theoretical models well established in the literature and the Slatter model, which uses both the rheology of the suspension and the particle size distribution of the solids. These models are used to analyze the experimental data and the effect that particle size and the particle size distribution has on turbulent flow behaviour. The literature concerning the rheological fundamentals relevant to fluid flow in pipes has been examined. The Newtonian turbulent flow model as well as the non-Newtonian models of Dodge \& Metzner, Torrance, Kemblowski \& Kolodziejski, Wilson \& Thomas and Slatter have been reviewed. Test work was conducted at the University of Cape Town's Hydrotransport Research Laboratory using a pumped recirculating pipe test rig. The test apparatus has been fully described and calibration and test procedures to enable collecting of accurate pipeline data have been presented. Three slurries were used in test work namely kaolin clay, mixture I (kaolin clay and rock flour) and mixture 2 (kaolin clay, rock flour and sand) with ad,s particle size ranging from 24/Lm to 170/Lm. The yield pseudoplastic model has been used to model and predict the laminar flow of the suspensions that were tested and the method adopted by Neill (1988) has been used to determine the rheological constants. The pipeline test results have been presented as pseudo-shear diagrams together with the theoretical model lines providing a visual appraisal of the performance of each model. The Slatter model predicts the test data best with the other theoretical models that were considered tending to under predict the head loss. The reason the Slatter model performs better than the other theoretical models is because this model can account for the wall roughness and particle roughness effect. Evidence to support this statement has been presented. This thesis highlights the fact that the particle size distribution is a vitally important property of the suspension and that it does influence turbulent flow behaviour. It shows that turbulence modelling using the particle roughness effect (eg Slatter, 1994) is valid and can be adopted for non-Newtonian slurries. It is concluded that the particle size distribution must be used to determine the particle roughness effect and this effect must be incorporated in the turbulent flow analysis of non-Newtonian slurries.},

  abstract = {CFD calculations of turbulent flow near smooth walls generally employ one of two broad strategies to resolve the very influential, complex, but thin near-wall viscosity-affected sub-layer. One approach uses a fine numerical mesh and a turbulence model incorporating viscous influences; the other employs “wall functions”—formulae that attempt to account for the overall resistance of the sublayer to momentum and heat transport. The latter requires only a fraction of the computational effort of the former and is thus strongly favoured for industrial calculations. However, the wall-function performance is often poor, partly because of inappropriate implementations and partly because the schemes themselves have inherent limitations. The present paper reviews the evolution of wall-function strategies. Attention is then given to two new schemes developed by the authors, one based on an analytical treatment and the other on a numerical resolution of the near-wall sub-layer. Several applications are shown of mixed and forced convection.},

  isbn = {978-0-7918-4545-5},
  doi = {10.1115/OMAE2014-23959},
  abstract = {Mechanical friction is one of the most important aspects in highly inclined wellbores such as extended reach drilling (ERD) and through tubing extended reach drilling (TTERD). Friction caused by the contact between the drill string and the well casing or borehole is dependent to the drilling weight and fluid properties. Drilling fluids play an important role on mechanical friction and using oil based drilling fluids with higher lubricity can reduce torque and drag and minimize stick and slip concerns. Reducing mechanical friction will improve drilling efficiency in general, and will in particular enable longer reach for ERD wells. This paper presents results from experimental laboratory tests where mechanical friction has been investigated in non-circular wellbore geometry. The experiments have been conducted as part of a research project in the tribology lab in Technical University of Luleaa.The project was sponsored by the Research Council of Norway and four oil companies. Friction behavior has been investigated for two different drilling fluids; water based and oil based drilling fluids both with and without solid particles. A pin on disc setup was used for these experiments where a spherical steel pin was sliding on a rotational disc made of granite. Friction force has been measured in constant sliding speed and in presence of particles in wet condition. The test results show that mechanical friction is smaller with oil based than water based drilling fluids in the presence of solid particles. In addition, the friction coefficient depends to the particle types and is higher when solid particles were added to the lubricants. Such experiments in a tribology laboratory are important to identify the effect of drilling fluid on mechanical friction from a basic point of view isolated from the other wellbore parameters. Test results and the experimental approach could therefore be of value for any one working with drilling and well construction.},

An 80 mm flow loop with recirculation facilities was constructedto measure the critical velocities of the sandbeds. The tests were carriedout by observing the movement of the bedparticles in a transparent pipe while regulating the ?owrate of the ?uid. Water andaqueous solutions of PolyAnoinic Cellulose were used as a test ?uid. The critical velocities of four sand beds with di?erent particle size ranges were measured. The model was used to predict the critical velocities of the beds. The model predictions and experimentally measured data show satisfactory agreement. The results also indicatedthat the critical velocity is influenced by the properties of the fluid, flow parameters, and particle size.},

  doi = {10.1063/1.4895780},
  abstract = {Addition of a small amount of very large polymer molecules or micelle-forming surfactants to a liquid can dramatically reduce the energy dissipation it exhibits in the turbulent flow regime. This rheological drag reduction phenomenon is widely used, for example, in the Alaska pipeline, but it is not well-understood, and no comparable technology exists to reduce turbulent energy consumption in flows of gases, inwhich polymers or surfactants cannot be dissolved. The most striking feature of this phe- nomenon is the existence of a so-called maximum drag reduction (MDR) asymptote: for a given geometry and driving force, there is a maximum level of drag reduction that can be achieved through addition of polymers. Changing the concentration, molecular weight or even the chemical structure of the additives has little to no effect on this asymptotic value. This universality is the major puzzle of drag reduction. We describe direct numerical simulations of turbulent minimal channel flow of Newtonian fluids and viscoelastic polymer solutions. Even in the absence of polymers, we show that there are intervals of “hibernating” turbulence that display very low drag as well as many other features of the MDR asymptote observed in polymer solutions. As Weissenberg number increases to moderate values the frequency of these intervals also increases, and a simple theory captures key features of the intermittent dynamics observed in the simulations. At higher Weissenberg number, these intervals are altered – for example, their duration becomes substantially longer and the instantaneous Reynolds shear stress during them becomes very small. Additionally, simulations of “edge states,” dynamical trajectories that lie on the boundary between turbulent and laminar flow, display characteristics that are similar to those of hibernating turbulence and thus to the MDR asymptote, again even in the absence of polymer additives. Based on these observations, we propose a tentative unified description of rheological drag reduction. The existence of MDR-like intervals even in the absence of additives sheds light on the observed universality of MDR and may ultimately lead to new flow control approaches for improving energy efficiency in a wide range of processes.},

  abstract = {Several concentrate and tailing pipelines use leak detection systems to predict system ruptures and minimise response times in case of or before the occurrence of pipeline ruptures. Those of internal type compare a set of model predictions for pressure losses and flows with actual readings from the system. Input data including solids specific gravity, concentration by weight or rheology curves, obtained either from periodic measurement campaigns or from installed instrumentation, are used to define values for rheological parameters such as the viscosity to be considered for such computations of head losses. In the present paper, an analysis of propagation of different error sources on the rheology identification and eventually on the computation of the head losses is proposed to investigate the relevance of system instrumentation accuracy and indirect errors derived by lack of instrument parameter update. A simple model for the calculation of friction losses for homogeneous Bingham fluids in the hydraulically smooth turbulent flow, a common regime found in copper and iron slurries, was considered. Assuming standard models to link the solids volume concentration with viscosity, uncertainties between 7\% and 12\% on the latter parameter are predicted for various conditions and variants of the referred mixtures. This is predicted to propagate to values between 10\% and 20\% on unit head loss uncertainties, provided errors between 5\% and 10\% on flow metering. Results suggest the inconvenience of rheology inference when using indirect leak detection systems, in favour of online or very frequent rheometric measurement during the transport process.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple new closure principle for turbulent shear flows. The turbulent flow field is divided into an outer and an inner region. The inner region is made up of a log-law region and a wall layer. The wall layer is viewed in terms of the well known inrush-sweep-burst sequence observed since 1967. It is modelled as a transient laminar sub-boundary layer, which obeys the Stokes solution for an impulsively started flat plate. The wall layer may also be modelled with a steady state solution by adding a damping function to the log-law. Closure is achieved by matching the unsteady and steady state solutions at the edge of the wall layer. This procedure in effect feeds information about the transient coherent structures back into the time-averaged solution and determines theoretically the numerical coefficient of the logarithmic law of the wall The method gives a new technique for writing accurate wall functions, valid for all Reynolds numbers, in computer fluid dynamics (CFD) programmes.

The simulating strategy is based on a lattice-Boltzmann flow solver and the dual-viscosity Bingham model. Validation of the strategy is first performed for single phase (lid-driven cavity flow) and then for two phase flows. Lid-driven cavity flow results illustrate the flow’s response to an increase of the yield stress. We show how the settling velocity of a single sphere sedimenting in a Bingham liquid is influenced by the yield stress of the liquid. The hydrodynamic interactions between two spheres are studied at low and moderate Reynolds number. At low Reynolds number, two spheres settle with equal velocity. At moderate Reynolds number, the yield effects are softened and the trailing sphere approaches the leading sphere until collision occurs.},

The fluid should have realistic properties relative to field applications, while also being practical for the specific flow loop experiments. The characterization and tuning should ensure consistent experimental conditions with respect to rheological properties using different batches of chemicals, different fluid batches and during the experiments. The main tool used for fluid characterization was the Fann viscometer, which is a de facto standard method for rheology characterization in the oil industry. A water-based drilling fluid using laponite and Xanthan polymer was designed, and the fluid characterization allowed us to detect changes in fluid rheological properties due to aging and experimental use. Further, we were able to adjust the formulation to maintain the rheological properties with different chemical batches. Transient flow loop experiments with presheared and rested fluid respectively showed some differences which could be due to gelling effects. Further experiments are needed to conclude on this.},

Models have been developed to predict borehole pressures; however, there is only limited information available on the properties of drilling returns obtained during HDD installations.

We focused on low-Reynolds-number wall turbulence of non-Newtonian viscous fluid close to Newto- nian fluid to observe the deviation of the turbulence structures of fully developed turbulent flow near a wall from Newtonian fluid. From the results of the DNS, we found that, as for Newtonian fluid, the tur- bulence structures of these viscous fluids could be generally normalized but with locally varying viscos- ity. Performing the LES with the Smagorinsky model as a subgrid scale (SGS) model extended according to the results of the DNS, we evaluated the reliability of the extended SGS model. For the various non-New- tonian viscous fluids considered, the mean velocity profiles obtained by these LESs with the extended model rather than the LES with the standard model corresponded closely with those obtained by DNS. Consequently, we demonstrated that the Smagorinsky model of turbulent flows for non-Newtonian vis- cous fluid can be treated universally via spatial scaling of the locally varying viscosity.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with the mathematical modelling of fully developed turbulent flow of a Bingham hydromixture in a pipe. The mathematical model is based on time averaged Navier-Stokes equations and uses the apparent viscosity concept. The problem of closure of the turbulence stress tensor was solved by the two-equation turbulence model in which a modified turbulence damping function was taken into account. The final form of the mathematical model constitutes a set of three non-linear partial differential equations. The main aim of the paper is to demonstrate a significant decrease of turbulence near the pipe wall, as the friction factor is below that for a water flow. The paper presents results of numerical simulation of the frictional head loss and friction factor for slurry flows with low, moderate, and high yield stresses. Predicted frictional head losses have been compared with experimental data showing satisfying agreement. It is demonstrated that the frictional head loss and the friction factor substantially depend on the yield stress. The results of numerical simulation are presented as figures and conclusions. Possible causes of turbulence damping near the pipe wall are discussed.},

In this paper the analogy between these classes of flows is explored, and a new approach to derive a turbulent model based on a nonlinear constitutive equation is shown. In order to reach this aim, direct numerical simulation databases of turbulent channel flows are used and analyzed in the light of the classical parameters of non-Newtonian constitutive equations. The Reynolds stress tensor is expressed in terms of a set of basis tensors based on a projection of a nonlinear framework. The coefficients of the model are given as functions of the intensity of the mean strain tensor. The apparent turbulent viscosity, the first and second normal stress difference, are presented in function of the shear rate. A turbulent Weissenberg number, based on a characteristic turbulent time ratio of the first normal stress difference to the apparent viscosity is also presented. These material functions, exhibiting a shear-thinning behavior, are fitted with the power law (theCarreau-type) model. The range of the Reynolds number investigated was 180 ≤ Retau ≤ 2000. One of the advantages of the new algebraic nonlinear power law constitutive equation derived in the paper is that its dependence is only on the mean velocity gradient and can be integrated up to the wall.},

  abstract = {The 'law of the wall' for the inner part of a turbulent shear flow over a solid surface is one of the cornerstones of fluid dynamics, and one of the very few pieces of turbulence theory whose results include a simple analytic function for the mean velocity distribution, the logarithmic law. Various aspects of the law have recently been questioned, and this paper is a summary of the present position. Although the law of the wall for velocity has apparently been confirmed by experiment well outside its original range, the law of the wall for temperature seems to apply only to very simple flows. Since the two laws are derived by closely analogous arguments this throws suspicion on the law of the wall for velocity. Analysis of simulation data, for all the Reynolds stresses including the shear stress, shows that law-of-the-wall scaling fails spectacularly in the viscous wall region, even when the logarithmic law is relatively well behaved. Virtually all turbulence models are calibrated to reproduce the law of the wall in simple flows, and we discuss whether, in practice or in principle, their range of validity is larger than that of the law of the wall itself: the present answer is that it is not; so that when the law of the wall (or the mixing-length formula) fails , current Reynolds-averaged turbulence models are likely to fail too.},

Two-fluid model is used to solve the governing equations in the Eulerian–Eulerian framework. Effect of eccentricity and drill pipe rotation on the pressure drop, volume fraction and velocity profile are examined. The results are compared with available data in the literature and good agreement is found. The results show that the presence of solid particles in the annulus change the air velocity profile significantly and create two off-center peaks velocity close to the walls instead of one peak velocity in the middle. Eccentricity of drill pipe makes more accumulation of the cuttings in the smaller space of the annulus. Increasing the eccentricity increases pressure drop due to impact of particles with annulus wall and also particles collision with each other. Rotation of the drill pipe shifts maximum air velocity location toward smaller space of the annulus which results more uniform cutting distributions in the annulus and improvement in their transportations. Pressure drop in the annulus increases as eccentricity and rotation of drill pipe increase.},

  abstract = {Rate of penetration (ROP) plays a major role in drilling optimization and several attempts have been made to obtain a mathematical model for ROP. In this work, semi-analytical models for ROP were developed based on the original Bourgoyne and Young Model using real time bit records obtained from wells drilled in Niger Delta reservoirs. Simple regression analysis was applied on the equation on the parameter that contains differential pressure (j=4), to obtain regression constants which were then used to generate mathematical relationship between rate of penetration (ROP) and drilling fluid properties. Equations relating ROP to annular pressure losses, plastic viscosity for annular flow under laminar and turbulent conditions, as well as gel strength/yield stress were developed, plots obtained from these equations showed that penetration rate increases as annular pressure losses, and plastic viscosity under laminar and turbulent flow decreases, and increases as yield stress increases. Hence confirming the trend obtained from practical drilling experience, however the (R2) values obtained for viscosity and yield stress ranged between 50-62\% and 88\% for annular pressure losses. The (R2) values so obtained for mud properties such as plastic viscosity and yield stress/gel strength showed that although these properties affect ROP, their net effect is actually not as significant on ROP as they are thought to be, only annular pressure losses seemed to drastically affect ROP which is evident as it is directly related to equivalent circulating density (ECD).},

  doi = {10.2495/WRM090331},
  abstract = {This paper presents four explicit formulae to calculate the friction factor for all flow regimes present at Moody Diagram without iterations, including the critical zone, for four different problems. The first formula is used to calculate the head losses of pipes given its discharges, lengths, diameters, absolute roughness, the kinematic viscosity of the fluid that flows in the pipes and the gravity acceleration. The second formula is used to calculate the discharges of pipes given its head losses, lengths, diameters, absolute roughness, the kinematic viscosity of the fluid that flows in the pipes and the gravity acceleration. The third formula is used to calculate the diameters of pipes given its discharges, lengths, head losses, absolute roughness, the kinematic viscosity of the fluid that flows in the pipes and the gravity acceleration. The fourth formula is used to calculate the diameters of pipes given its lengths, head losses, absolute roughness, the kinematic viscosity of the fluid that flows in the pipes, the fluid velocities in the pipes and the gravity acceleration. The calculated friction factors are used to calculate the discharges, head losses and diameters of pipes for the steady state and for the extended period state. It’s presented a case study where it was possible to apply the first two formulae to calculate the friction factors for the steady state in a water main with nine pipes. The results show that the two applied formulae are working well because the calculated pressure heads of some nodes of the water main were compared to the pressure heads gauged in situ on the same nodes of the water main and the results were close.},

Direct application of the yield-pseudoplastic model to the pipeloop test work data enables determination of the rheological parameters used in the slurry characterisation allowing the use of the established laminar-turbulent transition prediction methods. This empirical study compares 9 established laminar-turbulent transition prediction methods, based on the modified Reynolds number approach, against 26 observed laminar-turbulent transition velocities using pipeloop test work results of two high concentration mineral slurries; zinc tailings and fly ash. The best performing laminar-turbulent prediction methods for both slurry types were able to accommodate the three rheological parameters; Yield stress, fluid consistency index and flow behaviour index to capture the complexity of these non-Newtonian slurries. Other future work identified during this study include; determining modified Reynolds number slurries actually transition at to challenge transition criteria of Re ̃ 2100, the influence of yield stress as more than simply an ordinate off-set in predicting transition, and the phenomenon of the spike in standard deviation of the pressure gradient during transition.},

  abstract = {Wellbore fluid applications continue to expand in complexity, necessitating more versatile rheological and hydraulics models amenable to efficient real-time data analysis. Substantial recent advancements have been made by numerous workers, applying the Herschel-Bulkley model to drilling fluids, highlighting the underlying importance of fluid rheology. However, this classic model alone does not fully describe the complexity of oilfield fluids. Therefore, this paper presents a Generalized Herschel-Bulkley (GHB) rheological model and hydraulic analytical method that accommodate a broader spectrum of wellbore fluids, whether of simple character, or having the complex properties of multiphase fluids such as foamed cement and high-density cements in addition to drilling fluids. The GHB model offers several advantages: (1) it readily reduces to several popular conventional models (Newtonian, power-law, Bingham-plastic, Casson, and Herschel-Bulkley), (2) it can provide additional flexibility for characterizing apparent viscosity functions of current and future multiphase fluid systems such as lightweight cements, foams, and high-density slurries, and (3) it can provide an effective generalized framework for developing friction prediction equations. A highly accurate numerical simulator for the comprehensive family of fluids modeled by the GHB model was developed for predicting laminar flow-friction loss in pipes and annuli. The computational method, based on several exact integrals of motion, could be made as accurate as desired by decreasing mesh size. While the simulator itself is not ideal for real-time application, the results of comprehensive calculations using it were incorporated into field-usable software by developing "generalized explicit functions" that encapsulated all the physics correctly. These practical functions are in turn used for accurately and rapidly predicting friction loss of the GHB family of fluids in pipes and annuli (concentric and eccentric) for laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow},

  abstract = {The equation of the rheo[ogical model of Herschel \& Bulkley and the relevant expressions of pressure drops, valid both for circular and annular sections, are applied to determine the three characteristic parameters of a drilling fluid, having yield pseudoplastic behaviour, and flowing in the drilling hydraulic circuit, starting from circulation tests, A typical standard drilling hydraulic circuit consists of the surface circuit (stand pipe, rotary hose, swivel and kelly), the circular section (inside the drill string with variable diameters), the bit and the annular section (the gap between the wall borehole or casing and the drill string). In this circuit the drilling mud enters the drill pipe, comes out from the bit, flows up to the annulus up to the surface, where it after a short time for cleaning is put back in the circuit. The parameters to be solved are the yield point G, the consistency index k and the flow behaviour index n. By means at least three flow tests at a certain drilling depth, with the bit off bottom, the pump rates and the relative stand piy pressures are recorded. The obtained N couple of values of stand pipe pressure and pump rate, the geometry of the hydraulic circuit and the fluid density are the input data for a numerical procedure to determine the three parameters of the considered drilling fluid. In this way, using this numerical process, a non linear system of N equations (with N23) with three unknowns (the three parameters of the fluid: n, k and Q is solved determining the Herschel \& Bulkley theological parameters. This procedure takes into account the more probable solution for each tentative value of the flow behaviour index nP considering the infinite couples of \& and k satisfying the input value of stand pipe pressure, and the mean square deviation is calculated for each tentative value of n+ the minimum value of the MSD gives the solution tern of the non linear system of N equations. In this paper a brief description of the mathmadcal model and the numerical process used will be reported and a calculation using field data tlom circulation test carried out in a surface section of an ultradeep well located in the \% valley, will be done. The results will be compared with the obtained results using the readings on the same drilling mud performed on Farm VG 35 viscorneter and it can \& seen that not always the theological tern determined from the viscmeter data coincides with the quivalent rhtmlogical tern found considering the drilling well as viaeometer. Besides the stand pipe pressure relative to an 17 1/2” run (from 2900 m to 3060 m) will be monitored using this prccedure: calculated SPP data using the equivalent theological tern and the theological parameters tlom viscometer readings, using different rbeological models such as Bingham, Ostwald \& de Wade and Herschel \& Bulkley, will be compared to field stand pipe pressure data. It can be seen that the overall average error between measured and calculated SPP (using the Herschel \& Bulkley equivalent tern) has been drastically reduced to very IOW error while the calculated SPP using viscometer readings with the most theological models today used in practice could lead to large errors misleading an accurate evaluation of the SPP on the rig floor. This method could be useful not only to calculate and prdct exactly the SPP, but also to evaluate with accuracy the annular pressure drop and the correapordng BCD in order to have the maximum allowable pump rates without fracturing the erosaed formation, kides could be UWKI to monitor the SFP behaviour for potential occurring problem in the hydraulic circuit such as wash out, plugged nozzles and in the case of gas kicks in the well. Also this method, if applied to different drilling deptha, could give information on the influence of pressure and temperature, existing in the well, on the rheology of the drilling mud. During},

  abstract = {A finite element technique based on moving unstructured grids is developed to simulate the motion of a large number of solid particles in a flowing liquid. A generalized Galerkin finite element formulation which incorporates both the fluid and particle equations of motion into a single variational equation is developed for Newtonian fluids. The hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the solid particles are eliminated in the formulation, so need not be computed explicitly. An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique is adopted to deal with the motion of the particles. In the implementation, the nodes on the particle surface are assumed to move with the particle. The nodes in the interior of the fluid are computed using Laplace’s equation, to guarantee a smoothly varying distribution of the nodes. At each time step, the grid is updated according to the motion of the particles and checked for element degeneration. If unacceptable element distortion is detected, a new finite element grid is generated and the flow fields are projected from the old grid to the new grid. This generalized ALE Galerkin finite element approach gives rise to a set of non-linear algebraic equations which is solved via a quasi-Newton scheme. The corresponding linearized system is solved with an iterative solver using a preconditioned generalized minimal residual algorithm. Initially, the particles are positioned randomly in the fluid, with zero velocity. The particles are then released and the motion of the combined fluid-particle system is simulated using a procedure in which the positions of the particles and of the mesh grids are updated explicitly, while the velocities of the fluid and the solid particles are determined implicitly. Using the developed numerical procedure, we study the Poiseuille flow of solid-liquid mixtures in a vertical channel. The computation is performed within a unit cell which is periodic in the direction along the channel. The gravity is directed along the channel walls, and a pressure gradient is applied against the gravity and drives the flow. The solid particles are slightly heavier than the liquid. The effects of the applied pressure gradient, the particle Reynolds number and the fraction of the solid loading on the flow pattern of the solid-liquid mixture are studied. It was found that when the applied pressure gradient is large enough to overcome the gravity, the particles migrate away from the channel walls and there is a clear liquid layer next to the wall which lubricates the flow. As the particle Reynolds number is increased, particles interact more strongly and large clusters of particles are formed in the flow.},

The correlations are based on extensive experimental data on the flow of concentrated slurries of laterite and gypsum through capillary tubes and also straight pipe test sections in a slurry pipeline flow facility. The capillary tube diameters ranged from 0.103 to 0.400 cm, and the test pipe diameters were 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 cm (standard 12, 1 and 2 in pipe). For laminar flow the friction factor-Reynolds number relationship appropriate to the three-parameter Sisko model was derived, as rheometric measurements had established that this empirical rheological model did the best job of describing the shear stress-shear rate dependence for the test slurries, at all concentrations, over the whole measured range of shear rates; from about 1 to 25,200 s-1. For the turbulent regime it is established that the Blasius, inverse (14)th power friction factor-Reynolds number form is appropriate, with Reynolds number defined in terms of the high-shear limiting viscosity ￼￼amp; and the density of the suspension. These friction loss correlations are significant because the Sisko model, which combines a lower shear power-law region with a high-shear Newtonian asymptote, coincides with the observed shear stress-shear rate behavior of most highly-loaded fine particulate slurries over precisely the range of shear appropriate to pipeline transport.},

Since there has only one set complete experimental data available for the shear-rate dependent viscosity, we use them to show that a perfect match can be achieved between the modified power-law viscosity model and the experimental data. Such a perfect match is required for an accurate prediction of the flow behavior in internal flow problems.},

Since constant parameters of the eddy viscosity formula were used to derive the AWF, the predic- tion accuracy of the original AWF tends to deteriorate in complex flows where those parameters need changing according to the local turbulence. To overcome such shortcomings, the present study introduces a functional behaviour on the strain parameter into the coefficient of the eddy viscosity of the AWF. The presently modified version of the AWF is validated in turbulent heat transfer of pipe flows, channel flows, back-step flows, pipe flows with abrupt expansion and plane impinging slot jets. The results confirm that the present modification successfully improves the performance of the original AWF for all the flows and heat transfer tested.},

The current HDD practice of calculating annular frictional pressure loss caused by drilling fluid drag based on the assumption of concentric annular flow of a Bingham plastic fluid is demonstrated to be overly conservative. Consequently, critical design parameters, such as depth of cover, which affects crossing length, and drilling equipment size, which is selected based on anticipated pulling load, cannot be optimized. This can result in overly conservative design and unnecessary construction costs. Parameter values currently employed in HDD pulling load prediction are challenged suggesting that the viscous shear of drilling fluid is significantly less than typically quoted and that the friction coefficients often employed are not representative of all skin friction effects in HDD. A new real-time monitoring cell for large-scale HDD is described that can be used to optimize installations and to assess and update current prediction models.},

  abstract = {One important requirement for a drilling fluid is the ability to transport the cuttings out of the borehole. Improved hole cleaning is a key to solve several challenges in the drilling industry and will allow both longer wells and improved quality of well construction. It has been observed, however, that drilling fluids with similar properties according to the API standard can have significantly different behavior with respect to hole cleaning performance. The reasons for this are not fully understood. This paper presents results from laboratory tests where water based drilling fluids with similar rheological properties according to API measurements have been tested for their hole cleaning capabilities in a full scale flow loop. Thorough investigation of the viscoelastic properties of the fluids were performed with, among other instruments, a Paar-Physica rheometer. Improved understanding of the fluid properties relevant to hole cleaning performance will help develop better models of wellbore hydraulics used in planning of well operations. Eventually this may lead to higher ROP with water based drilling fluids as obtained with oil based drilling fluids. This may ease cuttings handling in many operations and thereby significantly reduce the drilling cost using (normally) more environmentally friendly fluids. The experiments have been conducted as part of an industry-sponsored research project where understanding the hole cleaning performance of various oil and water based drilling fluids is the aim. The experiments have been performed under realistic conditions. The flow loop includes a 12 meter long test section with 2″ OD freely rotating drillstring inside a 4″ ID wellbore made of concrete. Sand particles were injected while circulating the drilling fluid through the test section in horizontal position.},

Based on an Euler–Lagrange approach relying on the large-eddy simulation technique for the fluid flow and a particle tracking scheme accounting for all relevant elementary processes (particle rotation, transverse lift forces, inter-particle collisions, particle–wall collisions with smooth and rough walls, coupling between phases) several cases are analyzed in detail to elucidate the origin of secondary flow structures in the pipe cross-section. A smooth glass pipe and a rough steel pipe are taken into account at two different mass loadings considering a polydisperse size distribution with a number mean diameter of about 40 lm mimicking the corresponding reference experiment. After a detailed validation of the single-phase as well as the two-phase flow based on experimental and DNS data, the secondary flow structures are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. That confirms recently published experimental results that the secondary flow observed is of second kind. Finally, to prove that for another particle size distribution numerically investigated in the literature the secondary flow is still of second kind, rather large monodisperse inertial particles (134 lm) hitting the pipe walls with two different roughnesses are additionally simulated. The strength of the secondary flow is found to be strongly reduced for these cases compared with the polydisperse smaller particles, but the mechanism responsible for the secondary flow is the same.},

Comparison of the present results with reference data from the exper- iment of Aussillous et al. (2013) yields excellent agreement. It is confirmed that the particle flow rate var- ies with the third power of the Shields number once the known threshold value is exceeded.

  url = {http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/7693},
  abstract = {Turbulence is present everywhere in our environment yet its complexities remain one of the great challenges in scientific and engineering research. This work began out of personal interest. As such, it involved all aspects of my background, not just my engineering training. It is disconcerting to some westerners to think of scientists as philosophers. In the traditional Vietnamese culture, it is not possible to think of scientists as not being philosophers. In the old days we taught philosophy before we gave more practical training because all that we do IS influenced by our beliefs. I was educated in French schools and New Zealand universities while being raised in a strongly nationalistic culture. This bicultural upbringing led at some stages of my youth to a painful crisis of identity but it greatly enriched my life and coloured my approach to science. The reader will find the influences of this background in my ideas about turbulence. At one time, the West used to think of Asian beliefs as vague. I was first taught by an extraordinary Vietnamese electrical engineer that our description of the universe was in fact a binary progression. This is found in the Kinh Dich (in Chinese Yi-King, the Book of Change). This concept is not specific to the Vietnamese or Chinese cultures. It can be found in Indian thought, in Islamic Kybalion (their secret book), in Egyptian and South American cultures. Since that day, I have learned much more about traditional Vietnamese culture which is unconsciously reflected in some of the ideas I have developed in this research. We believe that all phenomena are periodic. The manifestations that look continuous may in fact be thought of as an endless repetition of events that regenerate constantly. They are not static. I was not unduly surprised to learn of Fourier analysis which decomposes a continuous function into a series of periodic elements. I was thus receptive to the idea that one can define a timescale even for laminar flow, when I found it. It became eventually a transformation between the penetration and boundary layer theories of heat and mass transfer (Appendix A4). We also believe, for example, that all things in Creation are governed by the same fundamental laws. In oriental medicine, it allowed us to understand and cure the human body by observing the laws that govern the larger universe. In essence, the organisation of the solar system is paralleled by that of the human body: there is a correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm. The reader will find a reflection of that thought in Chapter 9 where I endeavour to compare the information contained in time-averaged measurements to the those obtained from transient contributions. We believe that, like us, the Earth breathes. In the teaching of Khi Cong (the equivalent of Yoga) which I studied briefly, it is important to take note of and keep in harmony with this natural cycle since we derive so many of our resources from the Earth where we live. I have often wondered whether our environmental engineering would not have benefited if those ideas had permeated into Western science. To me, thoughts are not abstractions. They are concrete entities. We can now detect them through encephalograms. Thus thoughts that are conceived by a person are broad casted into the environment. If one is receptive, one can gather the wisdom of others around us. This is why Asian philosophy puts such an emphasis on emptying ourself of our own stray thoughts. This ultimate state of dispossession, mental as well as emotional and physical, is not easy to achieve because we tend to cling so hard to our own pre-conceived ideas. Vietnam can truly boast of having the most isolated scientific community in the world. The isolation imposed on the Vietnamese people by the Communists has forced many of us to face ourselves. In some cases it has been useful because this intellectual silence has made us much more receptive to the thoughts around us. In that sense, I have always felt that my work is simply the natural outcome of ideas evolved by my elders and colleagues in this field. In Phong Thuy (in Chinese Feng Shui, the art of shaping landscaping) the position where one buries one's ancestors is important because the configuration of the land filters the waves that are picked up by the remains of the deceased and transmitted to their descendants who are on the same wavelength. This is how innate talents are formed. As a people, the Vietnamese have had a wonderful ability to assimilate and adapt the culture of the peoples we meet, even those who tried to conquer us. The tragic history of our country during the last hundred years has unfortunately eroded the confidence of many among us. The unfortunate policies of the Communist government during the last seventeen years have hit particularly hard and we risk losing much of our fine heritage. It is particularly painful for me to see how many of my friends, some certainly brighter than I am, have given up on research because the facilities, if they exist at all, are so much poorer than anywhere else. In the later years, the driving force behind the present work was no longer pure interest but the need to show that, whatever the circumstances, our achievements are only restricted by our perseverance with the task at hand. The work became a statement of philosophy as much as one of engineering research. My hope is that my work will make a contribution to the field, that it will be recognised as such and in a small way help the Vietnamese nation find itself again.},

Annular cuttings volume, pressure drop, and cuttings distribution are recorded simultaneously within the simulation pro- ceeding. The CFD simulations show that pipe rotation makes cuttings presented in asymmetric distribution along the wellbore and significantly improves the drag effects on drilling fluid in the tangential direction. At a low or medium flow rate, pipe rotation has a significant impact on annular cuttings volume and pressure drop. However, there is no additional contribution of pipe rotation after reaching critical speed at high flow rates. Buckingham-p theorem combined with least square method was applied to establish the empirical correlations for estimating cuttings concentration and annular pressure drop.},

  volume = {2},
  doi = {10.12691/ajna-2-1-4},
  abstract = {Under certain drilling conditions, the weighting material particles such as barite can settle out of the drilling fluid. This phenomenon, known as barite sag, can lead to a number of drilling problems including lost circulation, well control difficulties, poor cement job, and stuck pipe. This study investigates barite sag, both experimentally and numerically, in the annulus under flow conditions. Experimental work has been conducted on a large flow loop to investigate the effects of major drilling parameters on barite sag by measuring the circulating fluid density. Results of the tests indicate that the highest sag occurs at low annular velocities and rotational speed and also at high inclination angles. It was observed that at inclination angles less than 60°, for any annular velocity, barite sag is not significant. Eccentricity of a non-rotating inner pipe did not have a significant effect on barite sag. However, effects of inner pipe rotation on barite sag for an eccentric annulus are more significant than concentric case. The simulation part of this study is based on a proposed particle tracking method called “Particle Elimination Technique”. The traveling path of each solid particle is assumed to be a function of size and shape of the particle, fluid velocity and rheology. Based on the estimated traveling path of particles, density of the fluid is updated considering the number of particles whose paths lead to the bottom of the annulus and become motionless. In order to capture the complexities associated with the solid-liquid flow, a lift force is assigned to the solid particles that enable adjustment of the model with experimental results. Comparing the results of numerical simulation to the experimental study on the effects of annular velocity on barite sag in a horizontal annulus shows a good agreement. The numerical simulation was modified from laboratory scale to real wellbore dimensions for practical drilling applications. Results of the simulation show prediction of the density of the drilling fluid in the horizontal section of a wellbore with various lengths and dimensions under different annular velocities.},

  abstract = {A great number of multiphase fluid systems within the areas of food, materials and chemistry
contain fibre-like components. Most of the "food fibres" originate from the organic raw
materials, which also compose the foodstuff (e.g. cellulose / polysaccharide fibres which can
be found in cereal, fruit and vegetable products). On the other hand it is conceivable to pro¬
duce specific fibre-like components (e.g. protein fibres) to be added to the fluid systems, in
order to alter the flow and the structuring properties in a defined way. In the domain of food¬
stuffs influencing these properties is important both for the process optimization and for the
development of products with stable non-demixing microstructures and structure-induced
sensorial texture and consistency characteristics. In the present work basic knowledge about
the orientation behaviour in sheared fibre suspensions was acquired and the influence of the
structuring mechanisms on the flow characteristics of the suspension was studied.
The image analysis, which was developed during this work, lays the foundation for the inves¬
tigation and the characterization of fibre orientation. Based on the Hough transformation, a
computer program was developed and implemented, in order to determine the orientation
angle of fibres in dilute suspensions. The source code of this program ("FindLines") was
written in the object-oriented programming language C++, with the use of the class library
MacApp. Apart from the actual transformation function the program contains all important
image processing algorithms and allows for a determination of the orientation angles even
when fibres are overlapping. In highly concentrated suspensions, rather than measuring the
orientation of each single fibre, an integral measure for the degree of fibre orientation was
defined. The necessary image processing steps are based upon the Fourier transform and
were implemented in the form of Matlab macro programs.
For the experimental investigations, special model apparatus were developed. In the parallel
band apparatus a uniaxial laminar shear flow can be induced, with a constant shear rate over
the shear gap. In particular, the orientation behaviour of a single model fibre was examined
in this apparatus. In agreement with calculations of Jeffery [25] and Bretherton [26], a peri¬
odical tilting motion of the fibre was observed in the shear flow. The portion of time the
observed fibres are aligned along the streamlines depends upon their aspect ratio (i.e. the
ratio of fibre length to fibre diameter). In a tube flow apparatus dilute and semi-dilute suspen¬
sions were studied. Starting from a random orientation, the structuring behaviour of the fibres
in the Poiseuille flow was investigated. For this purpose the mean orientation angle and the
standard deviation of the orientation angles of the fibres were determined. The higher the
fibre concentration was chosen, the stronger the fibre interactions were and the faster the
determined values approached an equilibrium value. In a parallel plate shear rheometer
experiments were carried out using highly concentrated suspensions of carbon fibres embed¬
ded in a polymer melt. Based on microtomic cutting of the solidified samples, the degree of
fibre orientation was measured by means of image analysis. Furthermore this shear apparatus
allowed for a measuring of the shear stress during the shearing. The obtained rheological data were compared to complementary measurements carried out in conventional rotational rheometers.
Concentrated fibre suspensions show rheodynamic and shear thinning flow characteristics.
The rheodynamic effects result from the orientation mechanisms of the fibres in the sheared
suspension, whereas the shear thinning is attributed to the pronounced influence of the par¬
ticle-particle interactions compared with the viscous flow forces at small shear rates. For ini¬
tially unorientated fibres the rheodynamic flow behaviour of a suspension can be
characterised by an rheopectic increase and a subsequent thixotropic decrease of viscosity.
The rheopexy can be explained by the multiple tilting motions of the fibres at the beginning
the shearing. These orientation movements lead to an increase of the particle-particle inter¬
actions and to a reinforcement of the fibre network. The subsequent thixotropic behaviour is
a consequence of the "destruction" of the fibre network, of the increasing orientation of the
fibres and of the resulting decrease of the mutual hindering of the particles.},

  title = {Prediction of Non-{{Newtonian}} Turbulent Flow Behavior by a {{Newtonian}} Approach},
  abstract = {One of the most important practical problems in non-Newtonian fluids flowing in pipes is the reliable prediction of the pressure drop accompanying the flow. For laminar flow, this problem is well established as the relation between the pressure drop and mean velocity can be derived by integration of the representative rheological model. However, the prediction of the pressure losses in the turbulent regime is still requiring more theoretical and practical analysis. The analysis in this paper has been focused on the observed phenomena that the turbulent flow behaviour appears unrelated to the laminar rheological characteristics and it could be found similar to Newtonian turbulent flow behaviour. The aim of study in this paper is to find a theoretical approach that could match the experimentally investigated turbulent flow behavior of non-Newtonian slurries flowing in pipes. The suggested approach is based on the similarity of non-Newtonian turbulent flow behaviour with that of Newtonian one. Dependence of turbulent flow behaviour on the laminar rheological characteristics and also will be discussed. So, the experimental measurements of kaolin slurries at different concentrations have been analyzed and compared with the suggested approach.},

  title = {Modelling of {{Transient Cuttings Transport}} in {{Underbalanced Drilling}}},
  abstract = {Underbalanced drilling holds several important advantages compared to conventional drilling technology. These include elimination of formation damage, faster penetration rate, ability for evaluation of reservoir productivity during the drilling process. As underbalanced drilling technology matures, it has also been used more and more. However, many aspects of underbalanced drilling technology remain poorly understood. The model presented in this paper seeks to understand the mechanisms involved in the transport of cuttings in underbalanced drilling. The model simulates the transport of drill cuttings in an annulus of arbitrary eccentricity, and includes a wide range of transport phenomena including cuttings deposition and re-suspension, formation and movement of cuttings bed. The model consists of conservation equations for the fluid and cuttings components in the suspension, and the cuttings deposit bed. Interaction between the suspension and the cuttings deposit bed, and between the fluid and cuttings components in the suspension, are incorporated. Solution of the model determines the distribution of fluid and cuttings concentration, velocity, fluid pressure, velocity profile of cuttings deposit bed at different times. The model is used to determine the critical transport velocity for different hydrodynamic conditions. Results from the model agree quite closely, qualitatively and quantitatively, with experimental data obtained from a cuttings transport flow loop at JNOC’s Kashiwazaki Test Field in Japan. These results show the importance of slippage in the formation of the cuttings deposit bed. The model is useful in evaluating the minimum flow rate for effective cuttings removal in underbalanced drilling. Introduction},

First, the accuracy of the CFD technique is demonstrated in the case of water. Then, a power-law fluid (Carbopol 971 solution) is examined experimentally and numerically and it is confirmed that by introducing the modified Reynolds number given in [1], the classic friction factor formulae can be used. In the case of the Bingham plastic fluids, CFD simulations were performed and friction factor curves for several Hedström numbers are reported which were found to be consistent with the corresponding literature.},

T wo types of solid parti cles were used; glass spheres and crushed rocks as irregularly shaped particles with different diameters and compared with each other. T he concept of equivalent spherical diameter (D S ) was used to calculate the diameters of irregularly shaped particles. The flow behavior for Non - Newtonian fluids was represented by Power - Law model. Two types of polymers were used, Carboxy Methyl Cellulose CMC with concentrations of (3.71, 5, 15 and 17.5) g/l an d polyacrylamide with concentrations of ( 2, 4 and 6 ) g/l. T he results showed that the drag coefficient decreased with increasing settling velocity and particle diameters and sizes; and increased as fluid become far from Newtonian behavior and concentrations and the density difference between particle and fluid. T he results also showed that the rheological properties of Non - Newtonian fluids have a great effect on the drag coefficient and particl e Reynolds number relationship, especially in laminar - slip regime and decreases or vanishe s at transitio n and turbulent - slip regime s. New correlations were obtained which relates drag coefficient with concentrations of polymers and with flow behavior indices for spherical and irregular shaped particles in Carboxy Methyl Cellulose CMC and poly acrylamide solutions.},

Specifically, the friction factor and diameter are expressed as computable series using Lagrange’s theorem. The equations presented in this study eliminate the need for best-fit parameters that are an integral part of the various explicit approximations proposed to date. The exact equations can also be utilized with advantage in optimization studies of pipelines. The ease, with which the new equations can be used, along with their smooth and predictable behavior, should make them the first choice of use for estimating the friction factor and diameter for laminar flow of Bingham plastic fluids in circular pipes.},

The effect of yield stress on the flow behavior is complex and not yet fully understood. The Ultrasonic Velocity Profiling (UVP) technique has been used to construct velocity profiles of non-Newtonian fluids flowing in a 10 m by 300 mm wide tilting flume. The contour maps were integrated to show that the velocity profiles were indeed correct. The thin film flow models available in the literature have been tested in terms of flow depth and Reynolds number. The measured profiles also show the influence of the side walls on the general flow features as the distance from the centre increases. The results reported herein span the laminar, transition and turbulent flow regions. As far as can be ascertained, it is the first time that this technique has been used to measure velocity profiles in opaque non-Newtonian fluids for open channel flow. It is shown here that, under appropriate conditions, the velocity profile and flow depth can be used to obtain the viscous properties of the fluids tested. Excellent correspondence between the rheological parameters inferred from the velocity profile measurements and that from the tube viscometry was obtained.},

A series of DNS on turbulent channel flow is performed for different rheological properties at two different Reynolds numbers. It is found that high drag reduction is achieved by suppressing the turbulent contribution for the high Weissenberg number, and/or by decreasing the viscosity ratio and the effective viscosity. A highly drag-reduced turbulent flow at a high Reynolds number is mainly caused by the viscoelastic effect in the elastic layer, where as the outer layer flow hardly affects the drag reduction. Moreover, we focus on the viscoelastic contribution term in the budget of Reynolds stress and its relation to the local flow pattern. It is shown that in the near-wall region of the highly drag-reduced flow a positive work done by viscoelastic stress is closely associated with vortex stretching that produces turbulent kinetic energy from stored elastic energy, whereas a negative one causes vortex compression.},

Krieger and Dougherty5 followed a different approach to analyse concentrated suspensions. They combined the result of Einstein with a self-consistent field approach and obtained a very useful expression for the viscosity as a function of the solvent viscosity (etas) and the volume fraction of particles (phi) as well as a maximum packing parameter (phim). The maximum packing parameter phim, though physically sound, was introduced in a very heuristic way. In this work we consider a model for the viscosity of particle suspensions which takes into account finite size effects and a clear physical interpretation of the packing parameter phim. In the limiting case of dilute suspensions the result of Einstein is recovered whereas the Krieger-Dougherty expression is approximately found for very small particles. Data reported by de Kruiff et al.6 were compared to predictions by the models. We find that the inclusion of finite size effects improves the model description for the viscosity.},

  url = {http://socar.az/1/Zhang_39-46-.pdf},
  abstract = {Microhole drilling is a new technology that provides many advantages, but at the same time there are also disadvantages such as high friction, poor hole-cleaning, etc. One of the biggest obstacles of microhole coiled tubing drilling is that there is no rotation of the drill string during drilling, which significantly reduces the hole cleaning process. Thus, the microhole drilling efficiency will be affected and, more seriously, cuttings accumulation may cause sticking which will lead to a microhole drilling accident. Therefore, a mechanistic model of critical velocity for cuttings transport in microhole drilling is required. This paper analyzed the suspension transport mechanism and the rolling transport mechanism, which are the main transport mechanisms for cuttings transport during microhole drilling. Then, a mathematical model of critical fluid velocity for cuttings transport was proposed. Model predictions indicate that the critical fluid velocity reaches a minimum value at low inclination angles. The position of the minimum value is determined by drag coefficient, lift coefficient and inclination angle. The critical fluid velocity for cuttings transport reaches the peak value within the scope of 50-70° of inclination angle during microhole drilling, and cuttings are more easily deposited to form a cuttings bed. The increase of drilling fluid viscosity tends to induce the critical fluid velocity for cuttings transport in micro wellbore and enhance micro wellbore cleaning. However, as the pressure loss in micro wellbore is large, the pressure in the well should also be considered in order to select a reasonable viscosity.},

Rheology is characterized by fitting the experimental data to the model of Herschel \& Bulkley (Herschel \& Bulkley 1926 Kolloid Z. 39, 291–300 (doi:10.1007/BF01432034)) yielding three rheometric parameters: consistency K (cognate with viscosity); flow index n (a measure of shear-thinning); yield stress tau0. The consistency K of suspensions of particles of arbitrary aspect ratio can be accurately predicted by the model of Maron \& Pierce (Maron \& Pierce 1956 J. Colloid Sci. 11, 80–95 (doi:10.1016/0095-8522(56)90023-X)) with the maximum packing fraction phim as the only fitted parameter.We derive empirical relationships for phim and n as a function of average particle aspect ratio rp and for tau0 as a function of phim and a fitting parameter tau∗. These relationships can be used to predict the rheology of suspensions of prolate particles from measured phi and rp. By recasting our data in terms of the Einstein coefficient, we relate our rheological observations to the underlying particle motions via Jeffery’s (Jeffery 1922 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 102, 161–179 (doi:10.1098/rspa.1922.0078)) theory. We extend Jeffery’s work to calculate, numerically, the Einstein coefficient for a suspension of many, initially randomly oriented particles. This provides a physical, microstructural explanation of our observations, including transient oscillations seen during run start-up and changes of rheological regime as phi increases.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with fully developed steady turbulent flow of slurry in a circular straight and smooth pipe. The Kaolin slurry consists of very fine solid particles, so the solid particles concentration, and density, and viscosity are assumed to be constant across the pipe. Themathematicalmodel is based on the time averaged momentum equation. The problem of closurewas solved by the Launder and Sharma k-epsilon turbulence model (Launder and Sharma, Lett Heat Mass Transf 1:131–138, 1974) but with a different turbulence damping function. The turbulence damping function, used in the mathematical model in the present paper, is that proposed by Bartosik (1997). The mathematical model uses the apparent viscosity concept and the ap- parent viscosity was calculated using two- and three-parameter rheological models, namely Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley. The main aim of the paper is to compare measurements and predictions of the frictional head loss and velocity distribution, taking into account two- and three-parameter rheological models, namely Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley, if the Kaolin slurry possesses low, moderate, and high yield stress. Predictions compared with measurements show an observable advantage of the Herschel–Bulkley rheological model over the Bingham model particularly if the bulk velocity decreases.},

  title = {Flow of a {{Non}}-{{Newtonian Bingham Plastic Fluid Over}} a {{Rotating Disk}}},
  abstract = {Even though fluid mechanics is well developed as a science, there are many physical phenomena that we do not yet fully understand. One of these is the deformation rates and fluid stresses generated in a boundary layer for a non-Newtonian fluid. One such non-Newtonian fluid would be a waxy crude oil flowing in a centrifugal pump. This type of flow can be numerically modeled by a rotating disk system, in combination with an appropriate constitutive equation, such as the relation for a Bingham fluid. A Bingham fluid does not begin to flow until the stress magnitude exceeds the yield stress. However, experimental measurements are also required to serve as a database against which the results of the numerical simulation can be interpreted and validated. The purpose of the present research is to gain a better understanding of the behavior of a Bingham fluid in the laminar boundary layer on a rotating disk. For this project, two different techniques were employed: numerical simulation, and laboratory investigations using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and flow visualization. Both methods were applied to the flow of a Bingham fluid over a rotating disk. In the numerical investigations, the flow was characterized by the dimensionless yield stress “Bingham number”, By, which is the ratio of the yield and viscous stresses. Using von Kármán’s similarity transformation, and introducing the rheological behavior of the fluid into the conservation equations, the corresponding nonlinear two-point boundary value problem was formulated. A solution to the problem under investigation was obtained by numerical integration of the set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using a multiple shooting method. The influence of the Bingham number on the flow behavior was identified. It decreases the magnitude of the radial and axial velocity components, and increases the magnitude of the tangential velocity component, which has a pronounced effect on the moment coefficient, CM, and the volume flow rate, Q. In the laboratory investigations, since the waxy crude oils are naturally opaque, an ambitious experimental plan to create a transparent oil that was rheologically similar to the Amna waxy crude oil from Libya was developed. The simulant was used for flow visualization experiments, where a transparent fluid was required. To fulfill the demand of the PIV system for a higher degree of visibility, a second Bingham fluid was created and rheologically investigated. The PIV measurements were carried out for both filtered tap water and the Bingham fluid in the same rotating disk apparatus that was used for the flow visualization experiments. Both the axial and radial velocity components in the (r-z) plane were measured for various rotational speeds. Comparison between the numerical and experimental results for the axial and radial velocity profiles for water was found to be satisfactory. Significant discrepancies were found between numerical results and measured values for the Bingham fluid, especially at low rotational speeds, mostly relating to the formation of a yield surface within the tank. iii},

It is the goal of the present study to investigate the effects which viscoelasticity has on this state and to identify the mechanisms responsible for wake stabilization. It is found through numerical simulations (employing the FENE-P rheological model) that viscoelasticity greatly reduces the amount of turbulence in the wake, reverting it back to a state which qualitatively appears similar to the Newtonian mode B instability which occurs at lower Re. By focusing on the separated shear layers, it is found that viscoelasticity suppresses the formation of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability which dominates for Newtonian flows, consistent with previous studies of viscoelastic free shear layers. Through this shear layer stabilization, the viscoelastic far wake is then subject to the same instability mechanisms which dominate for Newtonian flows, but at far lower Reynolds numbers.},

  abstract = {Hole cleaning is still among the most important problems to handle in drilling operations. The difficulty in removing cuttings bed during drilling arises because of the drilling fluid interacts with the cuttings in cuttings bed to form a cuttings bed gel. The drilling fluid composition can be designed to minimize the gel formation in the cuttings bed. At the same time the drilling fluid properties are optimized to ensure a sufficient shear stress on the cuttings particles to be able to remove the cuttings. This technique has been used in several of Statoil's drilling operations. The paper explains the effect of the cuttings bed properties on hole cleaning in detail. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how the drilling operations were improved compared to earlier drilling operations using conventional drilling fluids. From drilling operations in North Sea fields it is shown how the total drilling progress is improved. The torque curves of comparable wells are shown. These curves demonstrate that a significantly improved hole cleaning have been experienced in the wells drilled with the drilling fluid made to minimize cuttings bed gel formation.},

  abstract = {Many colloidal suspensions and solutions of macromolecules exhihit a viscosity which decreases with increasing rate of shear. This non- Newtonian behavior has been attributed to mechanisms in which the shear stress, transmitted through the continuous medium, orients or distorts the suspended particles in opposition to the randomizing effects of Brownian motion. Variation of viscosity with shear rate is then a result of the lowered resistance to flow offered by the oriented or distorted arrangement. Kirkwood and Plock’sl explanation of the viscosity of suspensions of rigid ellipsoids and F. Bueche’sz theory for solutions involve this type of mechanism. A more general theory of non-Newtonian flow, based on Eyring’s theory of rate processes,3 has been developed by Ree and Eyring.4 In this theory the viscosity is the sum of contributions of an indefinite number of unspecified “flow units.” Since it is not based on any particular model, the Ree-Eyring t.heory should be applicable to all systems. Unfortunately, the number of parameters required to de- scribe the behavior of a given fluid is not fixed by the theory, nor is it possible to deduce the values of these parameters from other known properties of the system. Reference to a forerunner of the Ree- Eyring theory, in a paper by Tobolsky, Powell, and Eyring,6, discloses a point of similarity between this theory and the orientation-distor- tion theories mentioned earlier. Both involve a competition between shearing and thermal forces, and in this competition the size of the suspended particle plays a determining role.},

  abstract = {After a century of need, the drilling industry finally has the tools to properly analyze and optimize drilling fluid hydraulics. This is indeed fortunate, because most unscheduled trouble events in drilling are still hydraulics related. Emerging results from these tools and recurring field problems and challenges provide many good reasons to rethink drilling hydraulics and rheology, especially in critical- well applications. This paper is about the reasons that made the Top 10 list. Real-time downhole pressure measurements, powerful / inexpensive computers, and quality HTHP / LT viscometers are among the most notable new diagnostic tools. Individually and collectively, they continue to remind the industry, for example, that downhole mud properties are different than those measured under surface conditions. Failure to compensate for significant differences in density, rheology, pressure loss, and other parameters can cause great difficulties, especially in wells drilled in HTHP and deepwater environments. Items in this Top 10 list cover a wide range of hydraulics and rheological issues. Some focus on specific well conditions, some address new findings, and others dispel long- standing oilfield paradigms. All are practical and useful for solving common and unique well problems.

  abstract = {Based on the notion of a construction process consisting of the stepwise addition of particles to the pure fluid, a discrete model for the apparent viscosity as well as for the maximum packing fraction of polydisperse suspensions of spherical, non-colloidal particles is derived. The model connects the approaches by Bruggeman and Farris and is valid for large size ratios of consecutive particle classes during the construction process, appearing to be the first model consistently describing polydisperse volume fractions and maximum packing fraction within a single approach. In that context, the consistent inclusion of the maximum packing fraction into effective medium models is discussed. Furthermore, new generalized forms of the well-known Quemada and Krieger-Dougherty equations allowing for the choice of a second-order Taylor coefficient for the volume fraction (phi2-coefficient), found by asymptotic matching, are proposed. The model for the maximum packing fraction as well as the complete viscosity model are compared to experimental data from the literature showing good agreement. As a result, the new model is shown to replace the empirical Sudduth model for large diameter ratios. The extension of the model to the case of small size ratios is left for future work.},

  title = {Pipe {{Rotation}} and {{Hole Cleaning}} in an {{Eccentric Annulus}}},
  abstract = {The drilling community generally believes that pipe rotation helps hole cleaning during both drilling and cementing. However, there has been a lack of reliable calculations to describe the effect and application in engineering and design and deployment. This paper discusses the effect of pipe rotation on velocity profile and pressure drop in concentric and eccentric annulus during the axial flow of non-Newtonian fluid. The calculations are applied to the design of hole cleaning during drilling and cementing. In the absence of reliable calculations one can only guess the impact of pipe rotation on hole cleaning. This work gives an engineer the tool to design for improved hole cleaning and hence save time and money during well construction and production. Pipe rotation is all the more important in an eccentric annulus to remove the drill cuttings and the gelled drilling fluid from the narrow annulus. This is because in an eccentric annulus, in the absence of pipe rotation, the fluid flows preferentially through the wider annulus. The pipe rotation speed (i.e., the RPM) required to move the gelled drilling fluid and the drill cuttings in various annulus configurations and eccentricities are presented. The results discussed in this paper can be applied for effective hole cleaning during drilling and cementing, which should save non- productive time (NPT) during drilling and cementing and also reduce remedial and intervention costs during well production.},

  abstract = {A cylindrical pipe facility with a length of 32 m and a diameter of 40 mm has been designed. The natural transition Reynolds number, i.e. the Reynolds number at which transition occurs as a result of non-forced, natural disturbances, is approximately 60 000. In this facility we have studied the stability of cylindrical pipe flow to imposed disturbances. The disturbance consists of periodic suction and injection of fluid from a slit over the whole circumference in the pipe wall. The injection and suction are equal in magnitude and each distributed over half the circumference so that the disturbance is divergence free. The amplitude and frequency can be varied over a wide range. First, we consider a Newtonian fluid, water in our case. From the observations we compute the critical disturbance velocity, which is the smallest disturbance at a given Reynolds number for which transition occurs. For large wavenumbers, i.e. large frequencies, the dimensionless critical disturbance velocity scales according to Re−1, while for small wavenumbers, i.e. small frequencies, it scales as Re−2/3. The latter is in agreement with weak nonlinear stability theory. For Reynolds numbers above 30 000 multiple transition points are found which means that increasing the disturbance velocity at constant dimensionless wavenumber leads to the following course of events. First, the flow changes from laminar to turbulent at the critical disturbance velocity; subsequently at a higher value of the disturbance it returns back to laminar and at still larger disturbance velocities the flow again becomes turbulent. Secondly, we have carried out stability measurements for (non-Newtonian) dilute polymer solutions. The results show that the polymers reduce in general the natural transition Reynolds number. The cause of this reduction remains unclear, but a possible explanation may be related to a destabilizing effect of the elasticity on the developing boundary layers in the entry region of the flow. At the same time the polymers have a stabilizing effect with respect to the forced disturbances, namely the critical disturbance velocity for the polymer solutions is larger than for water. The stabilization is stronger for fresh polymer solutions and it is also larger when the polymers adopt a more extended conformation. A delay in transition has been only found for extended fresh polymers where delay means an increase of the critical Reynolds number, i.e. the number below which the flow remains laminar at any imposed disturbance.},

  title = {Technical {{Report}} on {{NETL}}’s Non-{{Newtonian Multiphase Slurry Workshop}}},
  abstract = {The Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) sponsored a workshop on non-Newtonian multiphase slurry at NETL’s Morgantown campus August 19 and 20, 2013. The objective of this special two-day meeting of 20-30 invited experts from industry, National Labs and academia was to identify and address technical issues associated with handling non-Newtonian multiphase slurries across various facilities managed by DOE. Particular emphasis during this workshop was placed on applications managed by the Office of Environmental Management (EM). The workshop was preceded by two webinars wherein personnel from ORP and NETL provided background information on the Hanford WTP project and discussed the critical design challenges facing this project.
In non-Newtonian fluids, viscosity is not constant and exhibits a complex dependence on applied shear stress or deformation. Many applications under EM’s tank farm mission involve non-Newtonian slurries that are multiphase in nature; tank farm storage and handling, slurry transport, and mixing all involve multiphase flow dynamics, which require an improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for rheological changes in non-Newtonian multiphase slurries (NNMS). To discuss the issues in predicting the behavior of NNMS, the workshop focused on two topic areas: (1) State-of-the-art in non-Newtonian Multiphase Slurry Flow, and 2) Scaling up with Confidence and Ensuring Safe and Reliable Long-Term Operation. The participants were divided into three parallel break-out groups to discuss specific questions (Figure 1 and Figure 2) under each topic area and to identify the challenges and technical gaps, propose solution strategies, identify resources and references, and place priorities and timeframes to each topic question.
Detailed information on the 2013 Non-Newtonian Multiphase Flow Slurry Workshop and also the electronic version of this document can be found at https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/workshop/NNMSW-2013/.
Topic Area 1 Overview
Overall discussion of topic area questions tended to gravitate towards issues and challenges at DOE’s Office of River Protection’s (ORP) Waste Treatment \& Immobilization Plant (WTP) Project. Using WTP as a case study to discuss topic area questions was appropriate because of the immediate need to address technical issues at WTP and the fact that nuclear waste at the Hanford site represents one of the most challenging conditions for any of the EM clean-up sites. Hanford nuclear waste management is complex in nature due to various separation practices conducted over a long time period with limited documentation on the makeup of the feed streams into tank farms along with lack of data to fully characterize the waste stored in the tank farms. As a result, one of the common themes throughout the workshop was how to account for this large source of uncertainty arising from limited amount of data on the actual waste characteristics, and how to design representative waste simulant with similar rheological properties. Discussions also centered on the various Pulse Jet Mixing (PJM) vessel designs being considered to mix the NNMS and the challenges these vessels pose in verifying their design; WTP plans to conduct full-scale vessel testing (FSVT) for design confirmation of the heavily loaded non-Newtonian PJM vessels. Experts debated the ability of the Hanford clean-up process both at the tank farms and within WTP to control the rheological behavior of the NNMS to meet all waste acceptance criteria, mixing and safety requirements. Industrial experts provided practical suggestions on the use of rheological modifiers and, overall, the participants concluded that modifiers should be considered both at the tank farms and within WTP only after conducting a comprehensive cost-benefit based engineering analysis that considers the downstream effects and the increase in the plant’s lifespan due to possibly increased waste. Experts debated the use of predictive theories and the readiness level of various models for NNMS. In general they agreed that for many of the WTP PJM vessels, those considered single phase or lightly loaded Newtonian vessels, the readiness level of models is sufficient to warrant their use following appropriate verification and validation (V\&V) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) procedures. Issues surrounding the use of sensors and the availability of these sensors were discussed and, in general, concerns were primarily about the ability to quantify the uncertainties in the measurements at full-scale. A strong consensus existed for the increased use of sensors during WTP black cell operation.
Topic Area 2 Overview
The use of dimensional analysis to support proper scaling studies was discussed and widely accepted by the participants as a tool to support the design of NNMS tanks and the selection of simulants. Concerns about scaling up were raised because of the unsteady nature of flow, which transitions from possibly stagnant regions to highly turbulent regions, and the complexity of the PJM vessel internals. The experts agreed on the need for experimental data to verify any non-dimensional analysis. Similar to the discussions in topic area 1, experts discussed the uncertainties in the characterization of the Hanford waste. However, more emphasis was placed (and discussed) on incorporating chemistry effects and understanding cohesion and agglomeration. There was strong agreement among the experts that a parallel testing facility should be maintained during the commissioning and operation of WTP. The experts expressed a strong desire to increase the level of monitoring over what is currently being planned in the black cells during WTP operation. Finally, experts discussed the leveraging of existing industrial experience. While the WTP operating conditions and requirements are relatively unique, there are examples of commercial vessels operating in various industries (especially mining and oil-sands) which (a) are of similar size (and larger), (b) contain complex non-Newtonian slurries with settling solids, and (c) utilize gas spargers and other solids suspension systems. Every effort should be made to use the insights gained from these existing systems related to design, operation and erosion. A “lessons learned” exercise would be useful to learn from industrial successes and failures in the long term operations of processes at scales similar to WTP.
A total of ten topic area questions were addressed during the first day of the workshop and results of the break-out groups were presented to all the participants for comments and questions during the second day of the workshop. NETL organizers compiled input from the workshop and circulated it to all the participants for review and comments before circulating a draft workshop report for final review and comments. This report is an assemblage of detailed input from the experts.
The intent of the workshop and this report was to bring together a multi-disciplinary team of experts from industry, national labs and universities such that their expertise and past experiences can be effectively exploited to provide insight into how to address technical issues surrounding NNMS, which can then be leveraged by EM to map out and define priorities of future R\&D needs in the design of NNMS waste applications. The breadth of the topics discussed enabled the development of a holistic approach made-up of various design elements. The discussions during the breakout sessions identified the technical gaps for each of the design elements critical to the development of NNMS applications, and also proposed the future R\&D needed to overcome the identified technical gaps. Owing to the complexity of NNMS flows and critical technical gaps in the current state-of-the-art requiring long-term and multi-disciplinary R\&D efforts, although a roadmap is ideally needed for each of the design elements, such a road-mapping process was beyond the scope of this workshop given the wide breadth of the topic areas and limited time in discussing each area. This report provides a technical framework for designing NNMS applications and identifies the technical gaps and proposed solutions as perceived by the workshop attendees. It is anticipated that this report will be leveraged by EM to inform planning and map out future R\&D needs and priorities in staging and handling NNMS wastes and the information in this report can be immediately used by ORP in addressing technical issues associated with WTP-PJM non-Newtonian vessels.},

  abstract = {To manage the annular pressure profile during managed-pressure drilling (MPD) operations, simulations performed with advanced computer models are needed. To obtain a high degree of accuracy in these simulations, it is crucial that all parameters describing the system are as correct as possible. A new methodology for real-time updating of key parameters in a well-flow model by taking into account real-time measurements, including measuring uncertainty, is presented. Key model parameters are tuned using a recently devel- oped estimation technique based on the traditional Kalman filter. The presented methodology leads to a more-accurate prediction of well-flow scenarios. Although the present study is motivated by applications in MPD, the idea of tuning model parameters should be of great importance in a wide area of applications. The performance of the filter is studied, using both synthetic data and real measurements from a North Sea high-pressure/high- temperature (HP/HT) drilling operation. Benefits by this approach are seen in more-accurate downhole-pressure predictions, which are of major importance for safety and economic reasons during MPD operations. Introduction},

  title = {Model-Based Estimation of Multi-Phase Flows in Horizontal Wells},
  abstract = {The growing demand for hydrocarbon production has resulted into improved oilfield management with various control and optimization strategies. These strategies in turn strongly rely on the efficiency of downhole equipment which is used to obtain real- time oil and gas production rates with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, multiphase flowmeters installed downhole can improve the production of horizontal wells by allocating the zones of oil, gas and water inflow. However, existing multiphase meters are expensive, inaccurate or accurate only within a limited operating range and therefore such monitoring is unrealistic. To overcome these problems one can use so-called multiphase soft-sensors, i.e. to estimate flow rates from conventional meters, such as downhole pressure gauges, in combination with a dynamic multiphase flow model. The soft-sensors can also be used together with hardware sensors to improve their overall performance, e.g. by substituting missing data of the approach combines the accuracy of the conventional Kalman filtering with the robustness of the implicit forward modelling. The proposed algorithm is successfully applied for the solution of the one-dimensional problem of permeability estimation in a porous medium for a single phase oil flow. Finally, a new approach for optimal control and real-time monitoring of horizontal wells is presented. This methodology uses inverse modelling concepts to estimate downhole flow rates that are not measured directly. The analysis of transient pressure response due to a rapid inflow from a reservoir has shown that the available information is not sufficient to estimate simultaneously velocity and composition components, as they act on the different time scales. The real-time estimator proposed uses a dynamic model of the multiphase pipe flow and information from conventional downhole sensors. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been studied for simulation based case studies both for noisy synthetic measurements and artificial data generated by the OLGA simulator. The obtained results indicate that the model based estimator proposed is promising for real-time production optimization purposes. hardware sensor with output of the soft-senor. The research presented in this thesis discusses possibilities and limitations of such multiphase soft-sensors. First a numerical model has been developed and used to predict rapid transients in gas-liquid flows. A drift-flux model which describes one-dimensional gas-liquid flows in a horizontal wellbore is considered in this work. This model consists of a continuity equation for each phase and a momentum equation written for the mixture. The difference between liquid and gas velocities is taken into account using an algebraic slip relation. The numerical solution is obtained using an explicit flux-splitting scheme. A special treatment of the source terms, which characterize an inflow from the reservoir, is required in order to preserve the conservative properties of the scheme. This is achieved extending the schemes developed for non-homogeneous hyperbolic equations, where an integrated source is newly introduced, which retains an exact balance with flux gradients. This new wellbore simulator has been tested on a series of generic test cases, comparing it to data generated by OLGA, a commercially available wellbore simulator. The obtained results show that the new simulator provides accurate predictions of flow variables. An assessment of the time-integration scheme impact on results of data assimilation based on the extended Kalman filter approach is performed. The use of the implicit Euler scheme, which is unconditionally stable for the whole range of time steps both for the model and covariance update, results in a less accurate estimates, which can be overcome using a parameter estimator based on the explicit Euler scheme. However, the latter strongly limits the maximum time step, which can be used, and leads to inappropriate simulation time. An alternative can be found using a semi-implicit estimator, where a model is updated using the implicit Euler scheme, whereas the propagation of the error covariance matrix in time is based on the explicit time integration scheme.

material modeling. It introduces a terminology so that the material class ‘yield stress fluid’ is defined and can be distinguished
from the terms ‘solid’ and ‘liquid’. This new material classification is based on two criteria, the equilibrium relation and the
flow function. In line with this terminology, an experimental procedure for classifying the material behavior is presented. The
second key aspect of this paper is a discussion on the proper definition of the term ‘viscosity’. The benefit of the differential
viscosity over the dynamic viscosity in case of non-Newtonian fluids in general is worked out. This is shown by the most elementary
yield stress fluid, the friction element, because it is the basis of the yield stress concept. Its constitutive equations are
given for positive as well as negative strain rates and are also able to represent the preyield behavior. The theory presented
in this article is also applied to the Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt, and Bingham element to demonstrate the working principle.},

  abstract = {Due to their complex formulations, Drilling Fluids and
especially Oil base Muds exhibit very complex rheological
properties. They are commonly described as thixotropic shear
thinning fluids with a yield stress. A set of standards
established by the American Petroleum Institute is available
for the rheological characterization of these fluids and
classical descriptions with non-Newtonian fluids such as yield
power law models are typically employed. Although these
descriptions and measurements are adequate for classical
drilling situations, they reveal to be insufficient to describe
more complex phenomena as barite sag, or pressure peak due
to transient gel breaking on restart. In particular ultra low
shear rate rheology has been early accepted as a key parameter
for determining sag potential, and is poorly described by the
classical models and measurements. On the other hand, timedependent
behavior (classically apprehended in static
conditions through Gel 0 and Gel 10 measurements), which
can be very significant even in dynamic conditions, is not
quantitatively linked to the rheological description.
This paper describes how a simple thixotropic and structural
model is able to describe completely all the features of the
rheological behavior of drilling muds. The parameters of the
model can be simply deduced from on site measurement using
Fann 35 rheometer. We show that mud viscosity results at any
moment from the competition between aging and shear
rejuvenation. As a consequence, viscosity bifurcation (abrupt
transition towards complete stoppage or rapid shear) may
appear at low shear, which might explain the occurrence of
barite sag. Finally, it is shown how any transient phenomena
like pressure peaks when starting a pump after circulation
stoppage may be adequately predicted by using this model in
hydraulic calculation.},

cuttings transportation. This project work presents an experimental and theoretical approach
to the determination of stationery bed height during drilling operations. An experimental flow
loop was used to simulate the oil field drilling process in which flow velocity was used to
obtain a stable bed height. In the experimental work, drilling fluids of varying viscosity was
used in order to ascertain the effect of fluid viscosity on cuttings deposition and how it affects
other parameters. Also, theoretical models from past studies were used to compare with the
laboratory results. In order to ensure that the model was used independent of experimental
work, the author developed a simple geometry transformation from bed perimeter to height
based on circle geometry. The result obtained showed that the theoretical results for bed
height and perimeter were approximately the same as that of the practical result. The
minimum flow velocity obtained from the adopted model was higher than the recommended
flow rate from pump due to restrictions, as a result of laboratory and safety conditions at the

  abstract = {The relaxation time of drilling fluids is small compared to operational time, so under normal steady shear, the
viscous response is dominant. However, under infinitesimal deformation or high shearing speed, drilling fluids
behave viscoelastically. Viscoelasticity has received much attention from the petroleum industry since many
phenomena are related to it. Viscoelastic properties of fluid are the measurement of the gel structure, structure
stability and gelling speed. Hence, it governs particle settling and the invasion of fluid into the formation. These
viscoelastic properties can be determined through dynamic tests including oscillatory, creep-recovery and relaxation
tests. However, current rheological characterization is not sufficient to evaluate these important properties. In
addition, a standard test procedure for dynamic test is not available. Therefore, the petroleum industry still lacks a
rheological tool to evaluate fluids in term of particle transportation and structure stability.
In this search, creep-recovery test is used to obtain the viscoelastic properties of drilling fluids. A standard
experimental procedure is designed to obtain creep-recovery data of sixteen drilling fluids. This test procedure
provides a guideline for other experimental investigations. Creep compliance, a material function of fluid, is
analyzed and compared. A method of using creep-recovery data to evaluate the settling of particles is discussed. The
procedure to obtain the zero shear viscosity from creep-recovery test is shown in detail. To mathematically model
the viscoelastic response of fluids, a viscoelastic model, consisting of three Kelvin-Voigt models and one Maxwell
model, was used to fit the experimental data. The model parameters for each sample obtained from nonlinear
regression are presented.
The results of this study provide petroleum engineers a practical rheological tool to obtain zero shear viscosity,
predict particle settling and evaluate fluid structure stability. Our mathematical model can also be used to model the
viscoelastic response of drilling and hydraulic fracturing fluids.

  abstract = {Great significance is placed on the yield stress that is
determined for a drilling fluid. Less agreement is found on
what an appropriate range of yield stress may be for a fluid
system; nevertheless, most will agree that a sufficient yield
stress is critical for maintaining suspension of cuttings and
weight materials. However, the relevance of any particular
yield stress value for any drilling fluid is questionable.
While some rely on the traditional Bingham plastic model
and the yield point it predicts, this model and its method of
application has been found to be lacking in accuracy when
examining drilling fluids. The new API specification of the
Herschel-Bulkley model for prediction of fluid parameters
provides a yield stress that can be significantly different than
predicted by the Bingham plastic model. But is this value any
more indicative of the yield stress as directly measured by
rheological methods? On top of this lies the question of what
methodology is most appropriate for direct measurement of
the yield stress?
In this paper, a series of water-based and invert emulsion
fluids are studied through various methods. A comparison of
the results of yield stress predictions and direct yield stress
measurements will be made. Some effort is also given to
determining which of these is best applied to the study and

indefinitely) only if they are submitted to a stress above some critical value. Otherwise they deform in a
finite way like solids. The flow characteristics of such materials are difficult to predict as they involve permanent
or transient solid and liquid regions that are generally hard to locate a priori. Here we review the
present state of the art as it appears from experimental data for flows of simple (non-thixotropic) yield
stress fluids under various conditions, viz., uniform flows in straight channels or rheometrical geometries,
complex stationary flows in channels of varying cross-section such as extrusion, expansion, flow through
a porous medium, transient flows such as flows around obstacles, spreading, spin-coating, squeeze flow,
and elongation. The effects of surface tension, confinement, and secondary flows are also reviewed. We
focus especially on experimental work identifying internal flow characteristics that can be compared
with numerical predictions. It is shown in particular that: (i) deformations in the solid regime can play
a critical role in transient flows; (ii) the yield character is not apparent in the flow field when the boundary

stress picture have demonstrated that the effective viscosity increases very rapidly as the stress is
decreased towards the yield stress. Opponents have shown that this viscosity increase levels off,
and that the material behaves as a Newtonian fluid of very high viscosity below the yield stress.
In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally (on four different materials, using three different
rheometers, five different geometries, and two different measurement methods) that the low-stress
Newtonian viscosity is an artifact that arises in non–steady-state experiments. For measurements
as long as 104 seconds we find that the value of the “Newtonian viscosity” increases indefinitely.

Non-monotonic flow curves, stress overshoot during microstructure breakdown flows at constant shear
rate, and viscosity bifurcation are some of the common aspects of structured fluids that are predicted by
the new model. It involves two evolution equations, one for the stress and the other for the structure
parameter. Simple ideas are employed to describe the microstructure, and, as a result, a model with a clear
physical basis is obtained. In addition to the flow curve, which by construction is exactly predicted, it is
shown that the model is able to predict correctly the behavior observed in the usual rheometric transient
flows, among which abrupt changes in shear rate (microstructure buildup or breakdown experiments)
and abrupt changes in shear stress (viscosity bifurcation experiments). The model is frame-indifferent
and applicable to complex flows.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of the laminar, transitional and turbulent flows in a cylindrical pipe facility (5.5m length and
30mm inner diameter). Three fluids are used: a yield stress fluid (aqueous solution of 0.2\% Carbopol), a shear thinning fluid (aqueous
solution of 2\% CMC) without yield stress and a Newtonian fluid (glucose syrup) as a reference fluid. Detailed rheological properties (simple
shear viscosity and first normal stress difference) are presented. The flow is monitored using pressure and (laser Doppler) axial velocity
measurements. The critical Reynolds numbers from which the experimental results depart from the laminar solution are determined and
compared with phenomenological criteria. The results show that the yield stress contribute to stabilize the flow. Concerning the transition for
a yield stress fluid it has been observed an increase of the root mean square (rms) of the axial velocity outside a region around the axis while
it remains at a laminar level inside this region. Then, with increasing the Reynolds number, the fluctuations increase in the whole section
because of the apparition of turbulent spots. The time trace of the turbulent spots are presented and compared for the different fluids. Finally,
a description of the turbulent flow is presented and shows that the rms axial velocity profile for the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are
similar except in the vicinity of the wall where the turbulence intensity is larger for the non-Newtonian fluids.},

volume fraction during the flows in a Couette geometry of model density-mismatched suspensions of
noncolloidal particles in yield stress fluids. We observe that shear induces sedimentation of the particles

shear rate and particle diameter, and to decrease with increasing yield stress of the interstitial fluid. At
low shear rate (’plastic regime’), we show that this phenomenon can be modelled by considering that
the interstitial fluid behaves like a viscous fluid–of viscosity equal to the apparent viscosity of the sheared
fluid–in the direction orthogonal to shear. The behavior at higher shear rates, when viscous effects start
to be important, is also discussed. We finally study the dependence of the sedimentation velocity on the
particle volume fraction, and show that its modelling requires estimating the local shear rate in the interstitial

  abstract = {Materials such as foams, concentrated emulsions, dense suspensions or colloidal gels, are yield stress fluids.
Their steady flow behavior, characterized by standard rheometric techniques, is usually modeled by a
Herschel–Bulkley law. The emergence of techniques that allow the measurement of their local flow properties
(velocity and volume fraction fields) has led to observe new complex behaviors. It was shown that
many of these materials exhibit shear banding in a homogeneous shear stress field, which cannot be
accounted for by the standard steady-state constitutive laws of simple yield stress fluids. In some cases,
it was also observed that the velocity fields under various conditions cannot be modeled with a single
constitutive law and that nonlocal models are needed to describe the flows. Doubt may then be cast
on any macroscopic characterization of such systems, and one may wonder if any material behaves in
some conditions as a Herschel–Bulkley material. In this paper, we address the question of the existence
of a simple yield stress fluid behavior. We first review experimental results from the literature and we
point out the main factors (physical properties, experimental procedure) at the origin of flow inhomogeneities
and nonlocal effects. It leads us to propose a well-defined procedure to ensure that steady-state
bulk properties of the materials are studied. We use this procedure to investigate yield stress fluid flows
with MRI techniques. We focus on nonthixotropic dense suspensions of soft particles (foams, concentrated
emulsions, Carbopol gels). We show that, as long as they are studied in a wide (as compared to
the size of the material mesoscopic elements) gap geometry, these materials behave as ‘simple yield
stress fluids’: they are homogeneous, they do not exhibit steady-state shear banding, and their steady
flow behavior in simple shear can be modeled by a local continuous monotonic constitutive equation
which accounts for flows in various conditions and matches the macroscopic response.},

Besides, a stress-controlled rotational rheometer with a

the yield stress. The results in this work show that in
the limit of resolution of the PIV technique, the flow
behavior agrees with the existence of a yield stress,
but there is a smooth solid–liquid transition in the
capillary flow curve, which complicates the determination
of the yield stress from rheometrical data. This
complication, however, is overcome by using the solely
velocity profiles and the measured wall shear stresses, from which the yield-stress value is reliably determined.
The main details of the kinematics in the presence of
slip were all captured during the experiments, namely,
a purely plug flow before yielding, the solid–liquid transition,
as well as the behavior under flow, respectively.
Finally, it was found that the slip velocity increases in a
power-law way with the shear stress.},

The experimental investigation was carried out to obtain an improved database
for modelling the flow of coarse-particle slurries. Tests were conducted using sand
slurries and coal slurries in pipes of industrial scale. Frictional headlosses, delivered
solids concentrations, concentration distributions and velocity distributions were
measured as functions of in situ solids concentration and mean velocity. Solids
deposition velocities were determined visually using transparent pipe sections.
The experimental results were used to develop an improved two layer model for
estimating frictional headlosses, a force balance model for concentration distributions
and a method for predicting deposition velocities. The fraction of contact load, which
contributes sliding friction at the pipe wall, was found to be primarily dependent on the
ratio of the mean flow velocity to the settling velocity of the mass median coarse
(+0.074 mm) particle size.
The models contain empirical correlations which incorporate a wide range of
experimental conditions but are restricted to mixtures containing less than 35\%coarse
particles by volume. The correlations were tested using carrier fluids which were
essentially Newtonian with viscosities less than 4 mPa.s.},

  abstract = {Most calculations of particle deposition in turbulent boundary layers have been performed using an equation of motion in which the form for the lift force is that in a linear shear flow for a particle far from any boundaries, the so-called Saffman formula. Both direct and large eddy simulations of particle deposition in turbulent channel flow have shown that the dependence of the deposition velocity on particle relaxation time is over-predicted using the Saffman force. Since the derivation of the Saffman force there have been more general derivations of the lift on a particle in a shear flow. In this paper an ‘optimum’ lift force is formulated which represents the most accurate available description of the force acting on a particle in a wall-bounded shear flow. The effect of the force was examined through large eddy simulation (LES) of particle deposition in vertical turbulent channel flow. The optimum force for depositing particles is approximately three times smaller than the lift obtained using the Saffman formula. LES results also show that use of the optimum force yields a dependence of the deposition velocity on particle relaxation time less than that obtained using the Saffman form and in better agreement with experimental measurements. Neglecting the lift force altogether leads to an even smaller dependence of the deposition velocity on particle relaxation time and is in better agreement with empirical relations, although the deposition rates are smaller than experimental measurements for particles with intermediate relaxation times.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with a solid-liquid turbulent flow with moderate and high solids concentration,
which appears widely in chemical and mining industries. The slurry transported through a straight pipe contains
medium solid particles of averaged diameters higher than 0.1 mm and lower than 0.8 mm surrounded by water
as a carrier liquid. Mathematical model assumed that that flow is turbulent, fully developed and axially
symmetrical with steady viscosity equal to carrier liquid viscosity and density depending on solids
concentration. The model uses time averaged momentum equation and the problem of closure is solved by twoequation
turbulence model, which includes a new turbulence damping function specially developed for such
slurry flows. The mathematical model is suitable to predict slurry flow with medium solid particles and solids
concentration from 10\% to 40\% by volume. Numerical predictions were compared with measurements showing
good accuracy. Possible reason of turbulence damping which appears close to the pipe wall is discussed.},

Most work up to date dealing with particle-fluid interaction has been limited to rigid spherical particles due to the obvious
distinct advantages in both numerical and experimental studies. However, for most industrial applications particles
encountered are irregular or non-spherical and often with large aspect ratios. Commonly the use of equivalent diameters and
shape factors are used to describe the flight of non-spherical particles. For multi-parameter descriptions, where also the
orientation is taken into account, most work is only concerns slow viscous flow where an analytical solution exists. The work
done on turbulence modulation by non-spherical particles is scarce and only fundamental aspects are discussed. Finally this
work ends with giving suggestions for where further work is needed to advance the knowledge in the field of non-spherical
particles.},

  abstract = {The near-wall behaviour of particles is important in terms of predicting both the particle-deposition and the near-wall particleconcentration.
In this paper, we study the near-wall behaviour of elastic-bouncing small heavy spheric particles in fully developed turbulent
pipe flows without gravity, using direct numerical simulations (DNS) with a one-way point-particle approach. The particle-concentration is
assumed to be small enough such that the influence of the particles on the fluid and interparticle interactions can be neglected. The focus of
the paper is on: (i) the understanding of the differences between elastic-bouncing and absorbing walls, and (ii) the evaluation of simple
‘‘local-equilibrium’’ models. Our results show that the near-wall behaviour of elastic-bouncing walls is very different from absorbing walls.
The absence of a mean radial particle-velocity leads to a much higher particle-concentration near the wall than in the case of absorbing walls.
This can be explained by the absence of a ‘‘mean drag force’’: the ‘‘turbophoretic effect’’, due to the gradient in the particle-velocity
fluctuation in the radial direction, is balanced only by the ‘‘drift-velocity’’, due to a gradient in the particle-concentration. Our results indicate
that, from a pragmatic perspective, simple ‘‘local-equilibrium’’ models for the ‘‘turbophoretic effect’’, assuming a proportionality between the
particle and fluid ‘‘Reynolds-stresses’’, are adequate, except very close to the wall, where the reduction in the radial fluid-velocity fluctuation
is not accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the radial particle-velocity fluctuation.},

standard model (e.g., that presented in Sommerfeld et al. (1993)), in which the fluctuating fluid velocity
experienced by the particle is composed of two components, one correlated with the previous time step and a
second one randomly sampled from a Wiener process, and the model proposed by Minier and Peirano (2001),
which is based on the PDF approach and performs closure at the level of acceleration of the fluid experienced
by the particle. Formulation of a Langevin equation model for the increments of fluid velocity seen by the
particle allows capturing some underlying physics of particle dispersion in general turbulent flows while
keeping the mathematical manipulation of the stochastic model simple, thereby avoiding some pitfalls and
simplifying the derivation of macroscopic relations. The performance of both dispersion models is tested in
the configurations of grid-generated turbulence (Wells and Stock (1983) experiments), simple shear flow

examines the influence of particle diameter on additional shear stress due to the
‘particles-wall’ interactions for moderate and high solid concentration. The mathematical
model was developed using Bagnold’s concept, [26] and assumes that the
total wall shear stresses are equal to the sum of ‘liquid-wall’ and ‘particles-wall’ shear
stresses. The mathematical model was successfully verified with own measurements
of frictional head loss in vertical coarse – dispersive slurry flow, named: ‘sand-water’,
‘polystyrene-water’ and ‘pvc-water’, [10], [26]. The mathematical model can predict
‘particles-wall’ shear stress, pressure drop and friction factor for coarse-dispersive
turbulent slurry flow in a pipe, [10].
The aim of the paper is to present qualitative and quantitative dependence
of solid particle diameter, solid particle density, solid concentration, and Reynolds
number for carrier liquid phase on the ‘particles-wall’ shear stress. It is demonstrated
that the solid particle diameter plays crucial role in its dependence on the ‘particleswall’
shear stress. It was proved that in particular flow conditions the ‘particles-wall’
shear stress is much higher compared to the carrier liquid wall shear stress.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents a theoretical and numerical study of the problem of turbulence
in non-Newtonian fluids. The dynamics of these systems can be modeled
in terms of transported active fields and constitutes a subject of general interest
in the physics of complex fluids. Their peculiar rheological properties make them
attractive also for engineering applications.
The major part of the work concerns the problem of turbulence in dilute polymer
solutions, i. e. viscoelastic fluids. Two issues are considered: the small-scale
statistics at moderate values of elasticity in a regime of fully developed turbulence;
the destabilization of a laminar flow by means of purely elastic nonlinearities.
The effect of polymer addition on small-scale turbulence has been investigated
within a simplified viscoelastic fluid model, in a homogeneous isotropic configuration.
The modifications induced on the turbulent cascade have been addressed,
and their consequences on small-scale statistics, such as acceleration, have been
examined.
In the opposite limit of negligible inertial nonlinearities, polymeric degrees of
freedom can destabilize a flow, provided the elasticity of the solution is sufficiently
large. At growing elasticity, a transition to chaotic, and finally turbulent,
states is observed. The basic experimental phenomenology has been numerically
reproduced for a two-dimensional flow, and the statistical properties have been
characterized.
Another item considered is that of binary mixtures. Phase separation between two
fluids has been investigated, studying the phase ordering process in the presence
of an externally forced velocity field. The competition between thermodynamic
segregation forces and local shears has been examined in both active and passive
mixtures. Finally, the marginal role of Lagrangian chaos in the phenomenon of
coarsening arrest has been highlighted.},

  abstract = {An experimental investigation of turbulent non-Newtonian fluid flow and solids transport in horizontal concentric annulus is the main subject matter of this research. In the first part of this research, turbulent flow of water and non-Newtonian fluids in horizontal annuli were investigated by using the state of the art Particle Image Velocimetry technique. Different aspects of turbulent flow such as frictional pressure losses, velocity profiles, shear stress distributions and near wall turbulent intensities were analysed.
In the second part of the study, solid transport experiments were conducted using turbulent flow of water and polymer fluids. Various flow patterns of particle transport (i.e. dunes or separated sand clusters) were identified. Critical velocity and pressure loss required for initiating particle movement in different transport mode (i.e. rolling or saltation) were determined. Effects of fluid rheology (water vs. non-Newtonian fluid) and cuttings size (fine vs. coarse particles) on the critical conditions were investigated.},

  abstract = {Industries which pump sludges are under continuous pressure to decrease water content, and increase concentration. Environmentally
superior disposal techniques are demanding that such sludges have high mechanical strength properties. This results in a
sludge with an increasing viscous character. At high concentration, the viscous forces – which are usually highly non-Newtonian
and yield stress in nature – become dominant, and flows inevitably become laminar.
The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the effect and evaluate the impact that increasing non-Newtonian viscous stresses
– particularly yield stress – have on the pipelining problem.
An industrially relevant sludge pipe flow study is presented, demonstrating and quantifying the relationship between sludge
rheology and flow regime. It is argued that laminar flow will result in settlable solids accumulating on the pipe invert, leading to
pipe blockage. Although some practical remedies have been proposed, this problem requires urgent and focussed research.},

We find maximum differences between Newtonian and viscoelastic liquids, with repulsion between nearby bodies in the Newtonian case and attraction in the viscoelastic case. Side-by-side arrangements of sedimenting spheres are unstable in exactly the same way that broadside-on settling of long bodies is unstable at subcritical speeds in a viscoelastic fluid. The line of centers between the spheres rotates from across to along the stream as the spheres are sucked together. The resulting chain of two spheres is a long body which is stable when the line between centers is parallel to the fall, but this configuration breaks up at subcritical speeds where inertia again dominates. To explain the orientation of particles in the supercritical case, we correlate the aggregative power of a viscoelastic fluid with a zero shear value of the coefficient of ratio of the first normal stress difference to the shear stress and for exceptional cases we introduce the idea of the memory of shear-thinning leading to corridors of reduced viscosity.},

  abstract = {This study describes the development and validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) methodology for the simulation of dispersed two-phase 
ows.
A two-
uid (Euler-Euler) methodology previously developed at Imperial College
is adapted to high phase fractions. It employs averaged mass and momentum conservation
equations to describe the time-dependent motion of both phases and, due to the
averaging process, requires additional models for the inter-phase momentum transfer
and turbulence for closure. The continuous phase turbulence is represented using a
two-equation k ⬚⬚ "⬚⬚turbulence model which contains additional terms to account for
the e⬚ects of the dispersed on the continuous phase turbulence. The Reynolds stresses
of the dispersed phase are calculated by relating them to those of the continuous phase
through a turbulence response function.
The inter-phase momentum transfer is determined from the instantaneous forces
acting on the dispersed phase, comprising drag, lift and virtual mass. These forces are
phase fraction dependent and in this work revised modelling is put forward in order to
capture the phase fraction dependency of drag and lift. Furthermore, a correlation for
the e⬚ect of the phase fraction on the turbulence response function is proposed. The
revised modelling is based on an extensive survey of the existing literature.
The conservation equations are discretised using the ⬚nite-volume method and
solved in a solution procedure, which is loosely based on the PISO algorithm, adapted
to the solution of the two-
uid model. Special techniques are employed to ensure the
stability of the procedure when the phase fraction is high or changing rapidely.
Finally, assessment of the methodology is made with reference to experimental
data for gas-liquid bubbly 
ow in a sudden enlargement of a circular pipe and in a
plane mixing layer.
Additionally, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed using an
interface-capturing methodology in order to gain insight into the dynamics of free
rising bubbles, with a view towards use in the longer term as an aid in the development
of inter-phase momentum transfer models for the two-
uid methodology. The
direct numerical simulation employs the mass and momentum conservation equations
in their unaveraged form and the topology of the interface between the two phases is
determined as part of the solution. A novel solution procedure, similar to that used
for the two-
uid model, is used for the interface-capturing methodology, which allows
calculation of air bubbles in water. Two situations are investigated: bubbles rising in
a stagnant liquid and in a shear 
ow. Again, experimental data are used to verify the
computational results.},

  abstract = {The steady-state flow of dense aqueous slurries in horizontal pipes with Newtonian and non-Newtonian (Casson) carrier fluids has been analyzed using a two-layer model consisting of a top layer of flowing suspension and a settled bed of particles. The coarse solids used have a wide range of particle density, average size and particle size distributions, and the fluids studied were designed to simulate U.S. Department of Energy Hanford site waste slurries. The Doron and Barnea (1987) two-layer model was modified and extended to the quantification of slurries containing wide particle size distributions, including high-density particles, as well as non-Newtonian fluids. The most important changes from previous models include an independent settling analysis for different particle size fractions, effects of the shape of the particles on the settling velocity calculations, and a new correlation to represent the turbulent particle dispersivity. To incorporate the rheological properties of the fluids, the Wilson-Thomas turbulent flow equation for a Casson fluid (Wilson and Thomas 1985) was used. The results indicate that the turbulent dispersivity of settling particles is sensitive to particle size and density. A new correlation is proposed to relate particle dispersivity to Archimedes number (Ar). The model also gives good estimation of the critical deposition velocity as the minimum of the pressure drop vs. superficial slurry velocity relation. The existence of a stationary layer can be observed and predicted by the model under laminar and turbulent flow conditions.},

  abstract = {Traditional rotational rheometry has been dealing with
ideal flow conditions (viscometric flows) using plateplate,
cone-plate or concentric cylinder geometries to
characterize complex materials, preferably in the linear
viscoelastic region.
Complex fluids, however are often difficult to measure
under these conditions. Sedimentation during testing or
slippage at the sample-tool interface have a significant
effect on the results and reduce the operation range of
the instruments.
Furthermore do viscoelastic flows by no means
represent the real flow situation in batch or continuous
reactors and processing machines during mixing and/or
incorporation of additives, etc. For example, in order
to simulate and to understand the gelatinization of starch,
a mixing element is used as the standard geometry to
avoid settling of the non soluble starch particles since
the early days of rheological testing.
Many complex fluids can be tested using the
rheometer as an instrumented batch reactor with
different types of mixing elements to measure under real
flow conditions (systemic rheology =$>$ the rheology of
the system including material and environment) while
even conducting complementary measurements, for
example conductivity measurements.
Since the flow is complex and the material behaves
usually non-linear, the calculation of a true or
representative deformation or deformation rate for the
mixing element is an issue. Based on a Couette analogy,
average deformation and stress coefficients can be determined which relate the motor rotation speed to
the material deformation rate and the measured torque
to the stress.},

in the primary cementing of an oil well. The fluids are visco-plastic and may get stuck
in the annulus if a critical pressure gradient is not exceeded. The model consists of
solving a nonlinear elliptic variational inequality equation for the stream function, coupled
to an equation for interface advection, or alternatively a concentration equation for the
mass fraction of each fluid. The key difficulty is to accurately compute yielded and
unyielded zones of the wellbore fluids, which we accomplish by use of an augmented
Lagrangian method to solve the stream function equation. We validate the accuracy of our
method against analytical solutions for stable steady-state displacements. We study the
convergence of the interface to the steady state, showing that the apparent meta-stability is
illusory. We then explore the effects of increasing eccentricity, showing that although the
interface may remain stable it becomes unsteady. Initially fully mobile flows are found, but
as the eccentricity increases further the narrow side fluids fail to move in the far field. The
narrow side interface can progress slowly through the static fluids by a burrowing motion,
but for still larger eccentricities even the interface becomes static and a narrow-side mud
channel forms.},

not deform, and above which they will deform and flow according to different
constitutive relations. Viscoplastic models include the Bingham plastic, the Herschel-
Bulkley model, and the Casson model. All of these ideal models are discontinuous.
Analytical solutions exist for such models in simple flows. For general flow fields, it is
necessary to develop numerical techniques to track down yielded/unyielded regions.
This can be avoided by introducing into the models a continuation parameter, which
facilitates the solution process and produces virtually the same results as the ideal
models by the right choice of its value. This work reviews several benchmark
problems of viscoplastic flows, such as entry and exit flows from dies, flows around a
sphere and a cylinder, and squeeze flows. Examples are also given for typical
processing flows of viscoplastic materials, where the extent and shape of the
yielded/unyielded regions are clearly shown.},

  title = {Numerical Rheometry of Non-{{Newtonian}} Particle Suspensions Using Coupled Lattice {{Boltzmann}}-Discrete Element Methods},
  url = {http://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/32651/},
  abstract = {A computational model has been developed which facilitates the simulation of particle suspensions in non-Newtonian fluids. The model employs the discrete element method (DEM) to represent a range of particle geometries. The fluid phase is captured using a non-Newtonian formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and full hydrodynamic coupling of the LBM and DEM is achieved using an immersed moving boundary condition [1, 2]. The developed model has the ability to simulate Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, turbulence, a range of rheological models (e.g. power law) as well as varying fluid viscosities and densities.
This paper outlines the extension and application of the non-Newtonian LBM-DEM model to simulate numerical rheometry experiments [3] and channel-flow analyses [4] using particle suspensions in power law fluids. The numerical rheometry procedure employs a three-dimensional periodic shear cell geometry, which is an extension of previous work that studied the behaviour of granular media in a cylindrical Couette rheometer [5]. Currently, the periodic shear cell is utilised in a displacement-controlled arrangement. Future work will investigate the feasibility of a stress-controlled arrangement which would facilitate the simulation of drained rheometry experiments under varying consolidation. This will require the development of a porous immersed moving boundary which can apply both normal and shear stresses to the cell geometry without affecting the fluid pressure. The channel-flow analyses utilise a three-dimensional periodic aperture geometry to study the development length of steady-state, pressure driven particle suspensions.
By directly capturing the physical phenomena which dominate the interaction of particles suspended in confined geometries, the developed LBM-DEM model can be employed to investigate a range of physical phenomena in the oil, gas and mining industries. Examples include sanding in oil reservoirs, proppant transport in hydraulic fractures, and fines migration and mud rush in block cave mines.},

  abstract = {An experimental study was performed to understand the relationship between fluid characteristics and its solids transport and
sand suspension capabilities. In this study, borate crosslinked guar gels were prepared at three different pHs. The linear guar was
crosslinked with borate crosslinker at concentrations from zero to the values where the gel exhibited phase separation at each pH.
These gels were then characterized for viscoelastic properties and suspension settling velocities. At each pH, a crosslinker
concentration was selected to evaluate the gels for their solids transport behavior in two large size slot models. The gels that
satisfactorily transported solids through the slots had similar elastic moduli. The results show that the fluid elasticity, not viscosity,
correlates with the solids transport capability of the crosslinked guar gels. Furthermore, the drag coefficients for the suspensions
settling in the crosslinked gels prepared at three pHs were dissimilar, even at similar Weissenberg numbers. The drag on the
suspensions settling in the viscoelastic guar gels was observed to be both more and less than the drag on the suspensions settling in
the Newtonian fluids. Further work is needed to better understand these drag behaviors on the suspensions settling in viscoelastic
guar gels.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work of Bingham and Schwedoff early this century
(Markovitz 1 985), many fluids of industrial significance have been shown
to exhibit flow properties intermediate between those of a solid and a
liquid. When the applied stress is less than a certain critical stress, the yield
stress, such fluids do not flow but deform plastically like a solid with
definite strain recovery upon the removal of stress. When the yield stress
is exceeded the fluid flows like a truly viscous material with finite viscosity.
This important class of fluids, known for their viscoplastic behavior,
encompasses quite a wide range of materials including concentrated suspensions,
pastes, foodstuffs, emulsions, foams, and composites (Bird et al
1 983, Utracki 1 988). Although a large amount of work (mainly experimental)
has been carried out, our knowledge on viscoplastic fluids is still
fairly fragmented as compared to other more recently developed systems
such as polymer solutions and polymer melts.
The past decade has seen a rapid development of new materials and new
technologies where there has been an increasing interest in the fundamental study of the rheology of fiber suspensions and solid-filled polymeric systems
(Metzner 1 985, Utracki 1 988). This change in emphasis in research
on fluid mechanics and rheology has brought together the well established
and matured field of polymer rheology and the more empirical area of
suspension rheology. Already the sophisticated measurement techniques
and instruments previously employed for examining viscoelasticity in polymers
have now been used to characterize the viscoplastic behavior in
composite materials. The high sensitivity of modern viscometric instruments
has made possible measurement of fluid properties at small deformations
in the stress region near or below the yield stress, where the
behavior has not been well quantified previously. This however has also
led to the discovery that some fluids, that have long been used as model
viscoplastic materials do not possess a true yield stress if the measurement
is made at vanishingly small shear rates (Barnes \& Walters 1 985). The
controversy over the existence of the yield stress however is not new, but
has persisted since the time Bingham and Green discovered that paint was
not a truly viscous liquid (Bingham \& Green 1 920, Green 1 920, Bingham
1 922). It was pointed out by these workers, and as more recent experimental
evidence (Wildemuth \& Williams 1985) has shown, that flow property
measurements for this class of fluid at low shear rates (or shear
stresses) are more frequently affected by instrumental effects than those
for simple liquids. Nevertheless, even if one accepts the notion that some
materials do have a true yield stress, measurements of this property usually
produce conflicting results depending on the techniques employed, the
criterion on which the yield stress is based, and often the patience of the
investigator as well (Hartnett \& Hu 1 989, Astarita 1 990).
This review attempts to provide the reader with an up-to-date description
of the existing methods for characterizing the rheology of visco plastic
fluids. Like other classes of materials, one can characterize a yield stress
fluid by means of appropriate constitutive equations (flow models) or by
a carefully obtained set of viscometric data using sound experimental
techniques. Since the yield stress is the most important property here, we
endeavor to give an appraisal of the available techniques for its measurement
and to discuss the complicating role of the yield stress in the measurement
of other rheological properties.},

  abstract = {AbstractGeneralised laminar and turbulent pressure loss formulations are presented that are suitable for both annular and circular conduits. In so doing, a new rheological parameter is introduced that provides a consistent link between turbulent and laminar flow calculations and flow regime transition criteria. The approach presented is independent of the form of the rheological model of choice, makes no assumptions about conduit geometry, can include the presence of a laminar plug flow region, accommodate drillpipe rotation effects and account for the effects of annular eccentricity. Simple, explicit and general formulations for approximating pressure losses over Measurement While Drilling tools (MWD's) and Positive Displacement Motors (PDM's) are also presented to augment the suite of expressions required for comprehensive hydraulic calculation over the circulating system. Furthermore, procedures for establishing realistic bounds of confidence for laminar pressure loss functions are presented - enabling computation of the degree of certainty attributable to such a calculation. This procedure is applicable to any function requiring fitted parameters, hence it has a broader application potential than just drilling hydraulics. The model demonstrates good agreement with measured data from studies involving real drilling fluids flowing in both circular and annular conduits.IntroductionThe efficiency and effectiveness of drilling slimhole, horizontal and underbalanced wells is markedly improved when reasonable certainty can be ascribed to all parts of the circulating system. Accurate quantification of system losses enhances the validity of calculated equivalent circulating density - ECD, and other drilling parameters and indicators. Advantages of more precise ECD estimates include: proper maintenance of the integrity of underbalanced conditions; prevents lost circulation; indicates the likelihood of a potential kick and improves overall drilling efficiency through improved hole cleaning. Unfortunately, the typically high annular pressure drops associated with slimhole (high aspect ratio, Di/Do) drilling operations cannot be accurately predicted through conventional laminar and turbulent flow functions (with such losses b ing as much as 80\% of total system parasitic loss). This is due to the use of the slot-flow assumption used to allow formulation of tractable annular flow functions. Errors attributable solely to this approximation increase significantly as the aspect ratio increases.Certain non-Newtonian turbulent flow friction factor correlations are also unsuited for specific applications due to the particular fluid types, and conduit geometry, upon which they were constructed. Consequently, confidence based on quantities calculated using conventional pressure loss functions may be low, with potentially detrimental implications for primary and incidental calculated quantities.This paper attempts to resolve some of these issues by presenting a number of new formulations suitable for application to hydraulic calculations for slimhole, underbalanced and horizontal wells. The role of the reological model is discussed first to establish their proper application within the context of the proposed model. In the section headed 'New Rheological Parameter' the in situ (or 'generalised') flow behaviour index is introduced with appropriate solution procedures. This is followed by a definition of a GRN under the section 'Generalised Reynolds Number.' P. 279\^},

  abstract = {Rheological behaviour is an important fluid property that severely impacts its flow
behaviour and many aspects related to this. In the case of activated sludge, the apparent
viscosity has an influence on e.g. pumping, hydrodynamics, mass transfer rates, sludgee
water separation (settling and filtration). It therefore is an important property related to
process performance, including process economics. To account for this, rheological
behaviour is being included in process design, necessitating its measurement. However,
measurements and corresponding protocols in literature are quite diverse, leading to
varying results and conclusions. In this paper, a vast amount of papers are critically
reviewed with respect to this and important flaws are highlighted with respect to
rheometer choice, rheometer settings and measurement protocol. The obtained rheograms
from experimental efforts have frequently been used to build viscosity models. However,
this is not that straightforward and a lot of errors can be detected with respect to good
modelling practice, including fair model selection criteria, qualitative parameter estimations
and proper model validation. These important steps are however recurrently
violated, severely affecting the model reliability and predictive power. This is illustrated
with several examples. In conclusion, dedicated research is required to improve the
rheological measurements and the models derived from them. At this moment, there is no
guidance with respect to proper rheological measurements. Moreover, the rheological
models are not very trustworthy and remain very “black box”. More insight in the physical
background needs to be gained. A model-based approach with dedicated experimental data
collection is the key to address this.},

  abstract = {The present study aims to bridge the gap between water hammer theory and non-Newtonian fluid
mechanics. To achieve this, a detailed numerical study is carried out to investigate the effect of sudden
valve closure on the flow dynamics of power-law fluids in circular pipes. An unsteady two-dimensional
pipe flow model is employed which takes into consideration both fluid compressibility and pipe elasticity.
The present model is numerically integrated in time using the fourth-order accurate Runge–Kutta
method while spatial terms are discretized using second-order accurate central difference expressions.
Present results show that laminar pipe transients are significantly affected by the shear-thinning and
shear-thickening behavior of the non-Newtonian fluid. Reported unsteady velocity profiles during the
pipe transient show an excessive Richardson annular effect in the case of shear-thinning fluids, which
is reduced significantly in the case of shear-thickening fluids. Present results also show that the shearthickening
behavior leads to more rapid attenuation of the fluid transient. Moreover, shear-thickening
effects give rise to excessive pipeline packing which results in a pressure rise at the valve that could significantly
exceed the theoretical maximum predicted by the inviscid Joukowsky pressure rise.},

  abstract = {The probability of drilling into salt in the average Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) well is extremely high. Some operators have even planned bottomhole assemblies (BHAs)/hole Sections through no less than five salt intervals. Obtaining the well total depth (TD) under authority for expenditure (AFE) requires optimizing drilling of these salt sections by choosing the most economic and reliable bit/BHA/reamer combination to keep rate of penetration (ROP) high while simultaneously mitigating shocks and vibrations in the components of the BHA. This paper highlights BHA dynamics of multiple BHAs by focusing on overall drilling dynamics and bit/reamer performance of the most popular hole sizes, 18 1/8 in x 21 in and 14 ¾ in x 16 ½ in. These techniques guide informed decisions on bit/reamer selection and drilling parameters that maximize penetration rates without sacrificing BHA longevity. A strong focus on shock mitigation is crucial for any successful salt drilling run. Lessons learned from multiple runs in multiple fields highlight the drilling practices that make a BHA run successful.},

  url = {http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A646790&dswid=1875},
  abstract = {Drilling after oil and gas becomes more challenging for every drilled well; deeper, longer, harder, higher temperature, higher pressure and more complex conditions. The equipment requirements and well integrity regulations make the wells increasingly more expensive. The well costs often dominate the total investments for field development. Avoiding trouble while drilling wells constitutes huge potential cost savings. One way of avoiding trouble is to detect deteriorating conditions in the well and initiate the correct remedies before the trouble evolves. By modeling the physics in the well accurate and detailed, normal well conditions can be defined and deviations from normal will indicate abnormal hole conditions. The initial goal of this thesis was to understand, investigate and further develop the mathematical model of the weight of the drill string when pulling it out of the hole, presented by Mme et al. (2012). The model was analyzed, evaluated and improvements were initiated. But difficulties arose during the work process and another point of attack had to be selected. An alternative model has therefore been developed and tested against field data supplied by Statoil. The tests gave some affirmative results, but all in all, the alternative model did not manage to match the field measurements in a sufficiently satisfactory manner. The main conclusion of this thesis work is that to model well conditions accurately, complex and detailed physical models are needed. To model the weight of the drill string when pulling it out of the hole in a sufficient way, the mass – spring model (Mme et al. 2012) has to be further improved and then tested against field cases. The alternative model can be used as a starting point for further development of a tool to detect relative changes of the main forces developing in the well. Another important finding was that to be able to recognize acceleration effects and phenomena happing in a short time interval, sampling frequencies of the field data should be at least 3 Hz. Also it will be beneficial to use field measurements collected consistently at fixed time steps. This would ease and increase the quality of the interpolation.},

  abstract = {Viscosity regularisation methods are probably the most popular current method for computing visco-plastic fluid flows. They are however
generally used in an ad hoc manner. Here we examine convergence of regularised solutions to those of the corresponding exact models, in
both mathematical and physical senses. Mathematically, the aim is to give practical guidance as to the order of error that one might expect
for different regularisations and for different types of flow. Our theoretical results are illustrated with a number of computed example flows
showing the orders of error predicted. Physically, the question is whether or not the regularised solutions behave in the same way as the

maximum errors, e.g. lubrication-type flows. In this context, we also consider the effects of regularisation on problems of hydrodynamic

  abstract = {The rheology and flow behaviour of high concentration backfill tailings are investigated using a modified Balance Beam Tube Viscometer. The viscometer is capable of producing reliable data using a computer based data acquisition system and three different tube diameters. The aim of this research is to determine the rheology of backfill tailings in order to predict friction head losses. The backfill tailings were prepared into four different particle size distributions each with a different maximum particle size. Each particle size distribution was tested over a range of high concentrations in the viscometer. The rheology of the lower concentration backfill tailings was successfully characterized using the yield-pseudoplastic model. It has been found that at high concentrations rheological characterization is impossible because the laminar flow region of the pseudo-shear diagram varies with tube diameter. This anomalous behaviour in the form of diameter dependence has been recorded in the literature. The results of high concentration tests on backfill tailings are investigated using the following theories to establish and account for the cause of the anomalous behaviour: Effective slip analysis - corrects the measured data for effective slip. Dense-Phase Model - based on the sliding friction between solid particles and the tube wall. Wall Effect - based on a reduction of in situ concentration due to a wall effect. Boundary-Layer Effect - corrects for the effect of a boundary-layer of liquid at the wall. Modified Friction Factors - takes into account the hydrodynamic lubrication between the solid particles and the tube wall. The existence of a thin layer of liquid at the wall is credible but not yet proven. The anomalous behaviour is linked to this layer. However a suitable method for correcting the measured data has not yet been established.},

  abstract = {Rheology of drilling fluids affects the frictional pressure drop and the
solids carrying capacity of the fluids during the drilling operation.
Drilling fluid rheology is commonly controlled by using a variety of clay
or polymeric materials, depending on the type of fluid used and the
demands of the specific drilling operation. Most drilling fluids possess
varying degrees of time- and shear-dependent thixotropic properties.
Among them, water-based fluids containing clays, such as bentonite,
exhibit a pronounced thixotropic behaviour. This characteristic can
have a significant effect on the peaks and troughs of pressure that occur
in the wellbore when the drillstring or the tool-string is moved in and
out, or when pumping starts after a break in circulation. Major pressure
fluctuations can lead to fracturing of the formation, loss of circulation,
influx of formation fluids into the wellbore, or collapse of the wellbore.
Thus, a practical means of accounting for thixotropy in hydraulics
calculations would be of great value for maintaining safety as well as the
integrity of the wellbore.
A simple model, based on the concept of a structure parameter, is used
to describe drilling fluid thixotropy. Empirical relationships are devised
that can predict the time- and shear-dependence of rheological
parameters within the range of shear rates encountered inside the
drillstring and in the annulus of the wellbore. The model has potential
for use in drilling hydraulics calculations.},

working fluid. This problem is particularly acute in situations which require working fluids with identical properties,
such as the development of scaling laws for the turbulent flow of drag-reducing liquids. In this paper, we demonstrate
that the viscometric viscosity, loss and storage moduli for two of the most common polymers used for flow
experiments, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and xanthan gum (XG), are practically insensitive to the chemistry
of the tap water used as a solvent, to the method of mixing, and to the biocide added. However, the properties of
CMC from two different manufacturers were found to be significantly different, whereas there was no difference
between XG solutions prepared from different batches from the same manufacturer. Our conclusion is that for a
given concentration in water, the properties of certain non-Newtonian liquids, such as CMC and XG, are essentially
fixed and reproducible. Although the situation is less than ideal, comparisons of fluid-flow data from entirely independent
laboratories can thus be made even in the absence of direct rheological measurements.},

  abstract = {Drilling fluids make up an essential part of the drilling operation.
Successful drilling operations rely on adequate drilling fluid quality.
With the development of new drilling techniques such as long
deviated sections and drilling in ultra-deep waters, the standard of
required performance of the drilling fluids continue to increase.
Narrow pressure margins and low tolerance for barite sag requires
accurate prediction of the gel evolution in drilling fluids. Increased
knowledge of how drilling fluids behave during low shear rates can
lead to better design of drilling fluids to avoid settling of heavy
particles at the wellbore. Settling of heavy particles at the wellbore
can lead to serious incidents such as stuck pipe, lost circulation, poor
cement jobs and well control difficulties. Studies on the gel evolution
of oil based drilling fluids could be used to optimize hydraulic
modelling and evaluate phenomena such as fluid loss, barite sag and
cuttings transport.
The objective of this report was to investigate the gel evolution, low
shear viscosity and viscoelastic properties of oil based drilling fluids.
Literature study and experimental investigations were performed on
water based and oil based drilling fluids to extend the understanding
of low shear viscosity of oil based drilling fluids.
Literature study performed on low shear viscosity of drilling fluids
confirmed that there is a need for improved models for describing
dynamic yield point and low shear behaviour. A case study performed
illustrates the relevance of the topic, and the consequences
unexpected gel effects could have when drilling a well.
Two water based drilling fluid samples and one oil based drilling fluid
sample were prepared and tested. Quantitative information about the
dynamic properties of drilling fluids was found. Flow curves and gel
strength were measured using a Fann viscometer. Four different
drilling fluid samples were investigated using an Anton Paar Physica
rheometer. Oscillatory tests such as amplitude sweeps determined
linear viscoelastic range (LVE). Determination of the linear
viscoelastic range was necessary to further investigate viscoelastic
properties by performing frequency sweeps within the LVE range.
Both amplitude sweeps and frequency sweeps were performed at
different frequencies and strains. The viscoelastic properties
investigated were structure formation, structure breakage and low
shear viscosity. The effect of variables such as temperature,
frequency, time of rest on dynamic yield point and viscous and elastic
modulus was investigated by varying these variables in series of
experiments. Experiments performed conclude that there is little correlation
between the dynamic yield point found from extrapolation of flow
curves using the Herschel Bulkley model and the Bingham plastic
model, and the dynamic yield point found from amplitude sweeps.
Amplitude sweeps showed that the three samples of drilling fluids
exhibit viscoelastic behaviour, and that the linear viscoelastic range in
strain rate was approximately 1 \% at a temperature of 20 °C and a
frequency of 1 s-1 for all tested samples. Frequency sweeps showed
that the elastic modulus dominates the viscous modulus within the
LVE range for all three samples. Linear viscoelastic range and
dynamic yield point were found to be temperature and frequency
dependent. The properties of the different samples were found to not
change monotonically with frequency or temperature. Results of
experiments performed on a model water based drilling fluid conclude
that time of rest had little influence on the properties even for longer
period of rest. A slight increase in viscosity was observed for longer
rest periods.},

  abstract = {By any standard of measurement, exploration activities in
the worlds deepwater and ultra-deepwater environments have
changed appreciably over the past decade. New records for
water depth and measured depth in deepwater are being set
regularly. Exploration and production activities continue to
expand into less-traditional deepwater basins, bringing with
them new sets of technical, operational, environmental and
economic challenges. Many of those challenges focus on the
engineering and application of drilling and completion fluids.
Accordingly, this paper revisits the top 10 mud-related
concerns in deepwater drilling put forward in SPE 590191 ten
years ago. The intrinsic subsurface environment of cold water
temperatures, narrow operating windows, gas hydrates and
other characteristics has remained unchanged with the
passage of time. However, over the past decade, a number of
technological advancements and operational approaches have
helped mitigate many of the associated concerns.
The authors revisit those top 10 concerns and discuss the
corresponding technology and operational solutions that have
since been introduced and applied to lessen their adverse
influence. The discussion will focus on advancements in
managing (1) lost circulation, (2) mud properties, (3) solids
transport, (4) stuck pipe, (5) wellbore stability, (6) shallow
gas hazards, (7) gas hydrates, (8) reservoir productivity, (9)
environmental issues, and (10) fluid-related logistics. Also
discussed are some emerging technologies that hold promise
in further management and control of these deepwater issues.},

  abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis has become a useful research and design instrument albeit with errors and uncertainties. Appropriate standards and protocols for increasing confidence and reliabil- ity need to be identified and applied. These requirements become more relevant as improvements in hardware, software and user competence increase. Advances in these sectors have led to the increased use of CFD codes in the applied research industry. In the discussion on the opportunities of applying Quality Assurance to Research and Development (R\&D) activities, and on investigating methodologies (numerical or experimental), CFD results need to be qualified; rules, and procedures should be instated and followed. This paper proposes a methodolog- ical approach to qualify CFD, named Q3 approach. The approach is based on three interdependent, but related, dimensions: software reliability, user knowledge and process control. Applying the quality of CFD analysis to industrial problems, while following the principles of Quality Assurance, is of particular concerned. The paper aims to focus on the dimensions of user knowledge and process control, which are often overlooked and are of great importance when determining the qual- ity of CFD. The approach discussed here refers to a typical R\&D department in a Small or Medium Enter- prise (SME) where a CFD code is used as a support tool for process or product development, optimisation and/or innovation. Within the three dimensions, software reliability immediately refers to Verification and Validation (V\&V) procedures, a well known issue for those who are involved in code and model development. User knowledge and process control play a vital role in achieving accurate results and cannot be neglected, as per the principles of Quality Assurance. Therefore it is vital to provide continuous CFD analyst training to industrial professionals. Applying a CFD cycled process, which refers to the cyclic logic proposed in Qual- ity Assurance, may face some constrains in specific industrial scenarios. A protocol will serve as an instru- ment of process control. Within the protocol, the phases of Calculation, Verification and Validation as well as User Defined Model Verification represent critical elements, and are specifically detailed and struc- tured in accordance with the RADAR logic (Results, Approach, Deploy, Assess, Refine) used for Quality Assurance Management. In the case a specific study does not rely on experimental data, an alternative is proposed. The protocol is designed as a single tool that responds to both the need for qualified CFD and the requirement of internal or external audit of Quality Assurance (as far as calculations are concerned), thus increasing cost and personnel efficiency},

format for recording the data, and (2) software that reads, writes, and modifies data in that format.
The format is a conceptual entity established by the documentation; the software is a physical
product supplied to enable developers to access and produce data recorded in that format.
The standard format, or paper convention, part of CGNS consists of two fundamental pieces. The
first, known as the Standard Interface Data Structures, is described in this Recommended

However, more than 35 years of experience in the estimation community has shown that is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems that are almost linear on the time scale of the updates. Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the UT.},

  abstract = {In order to manage the annular pressure profile during Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) operations, simulations performed with advanced computer models are needed. To obtain a high degree of accuracy in these simulations it is crucial that all parameters describing the system are as correct as possible. A new methodology for real time updating of key parameters in a well flow model by taking into account real time measurements, including measuring uncertainty, is presented. Key model parameters are tuned using a recently developed estimation technique based on the traditional Kalman Filter.

The presented methodology leads to a more accurate prediction of well flow scenarios. Although the present study is motivated by applications in MPD, the idea of tuning model parameters should be of great importance in a wide area of applications.

The performance of the filter is studied, both using synthetic data and real measurements from a North Sea High-Pressure-High-Temperature (HPHT) drilling operation. Benefits by this approach are seen by more accurate downhole pressure predictions which are of major importance for safety and economic reasons during MPD operations.},

  url = {https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-128286-PA},
  abstract = {Unrecognized axial and rotational movement of the drillstring can cause formation fracturing or fluid influx, resulting in costly remedial actions. With increasingly complex wellbore geometries and narrow geopressure windows, it is not always obvious for the driller how to estimate accurately the real maneuvering limits of the drawworks and the topdrive, especially under poor downhole conditions. The solution presented in this paper uses continuously updated safeguards applied to the drilling-control system to maintain a downhole pressure within the acceptable limits of the openhole formations. It automatically stops the movement of the drillstring in the case of abnormal hookloads or surface torques. Because automatic actions can be triggered in the case of an unexpected situation, some standard procedures have been fully automated, including friction tests and back reaming.

Numerical models are used to constantly calculate the maximum accelerations and velocities, which can be applied to the drillstring in the current drilling conditions. The resulting envelope of protection is dependent on many factors. Therefore, a proper evaluation of the downhole conditions is of paramount importance for the quality of the calculated safeguards. An automatic calibration of the physical models, on the basis of surface measurements, is at the heart of the system. The calibrated mechanical models are used to determine the limits for abnormal surface torques or hookloads. It is, therefore, possible to take actions automatically in the case of overpull, set-down weight, or high torque.

In 2008, a preliminary version of the system was tested during the drilling of a well in the North Sea. Even though the control algorithms did work well at that time, it was noticed that, in some circumstances, the drilling-control system would not be ready in time for fast-changing drilling conditions. An improved version of the drawworks and topdrive automation system has been tested during the drilling of three North Sea wells in the spring of 2009. In this last version, the response time of the system has been optimal at all times. The drillers involved in the testing of the system have found the system useful and user friendly.},

  abstract = {Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of "intelligent" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and "intelligent" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of "plug-and-play" PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to construct semi-implicit numerical schemes for a two-phase (two-fluid) flow model, allowing for violation of the CFL criterion for sonic waves while maintaining a high level of accuracy and stability on volume fraction waves.

By using an appropriate hybridization of a robust implicit flux and an upwind explicit flux, we obtain a class of first-order schemes, which we refer to as weakly implicit mixture flux (WIMF) methods. In particular, by using an advection upstream splitting method (AUSMD) type of upwind flux [S. Evje and T. Flåtten, J. Comput. Phys., 192 (2003), pp. 175--210], we obtain a scheme denoted as WIMF-AUSMD.

We present several numerical simulations, all of them indicating that the CFL-stability of the WIMF-AUSMD scheme is governed by the velocity of the volume fraction waves and not the rapid sonic waves. Comparisons with an explicit Roe scheme indicate that the scheme presented in this paper is highly efficient, robust, and accurate on slow transients. By exploiting the possibility to take much larger time steps, it outperforms the Roe scheme in the resolution of the volume fraction wave for the classical water faucet problem. On the other hand, it is more diffusive on pressure waves.

Although conservation of positivity for the masses is not proved, we demonstrate that a fix may be applied, making the scheme able to handle the transition to one-phase flow while maintaining a high level of accuracy on volume fraction fronts.},

Based on the Weakly Implixit Mixture Flux (WIMF) approach [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 26 (2005), pp. 1449–1484], we here develop an extension denoted as Strongly Implicit Mixture Flux (SIMF). Whereas the WIMF schemes are restricted by a weak CFL condition which relates time steps to the fluid velocity, the SIMF schemes are able to break the CFL conditions corresponding to both the sonic and advective velocities. The schemes possess some desirable features compared to current industrial pressure-based codes. They allow for sequential updating of the momentum and mass variables on a nonstaggered grid by solving two sparse linear systems. The schemes are conservative in all convective fluxes and consistency between the mass variables and pressure is formally maintained. Numerical experiments are presented to shed light on the inherent differences between the WIMF and SIMF families of schemes. In particular, we demonstrate that the WIMF scheme is able to give an exact resolution of a moving contact discontinuity. The SIMF schemes do not possess the “exact resolution” property of WIMF, however, the ability to take larger time steps can be exploited so that more efficient calculations can be made when accurate resolution of sharp fronts is not essential, e.g. to calculate steady state solutions.},

  abstract = {This work deals with a viscous two-phase liquid–gas model relevant to the flow in wells and pipelines. The liquid is treated as an incompressible fluid whereas the gas is assumed to be polytropic. The model is rewritten in terms of Lagrangian coordinates and is studied in a free boundary setting where the liquid and gas masses are of compact support initially, and continuous at the boundary. Consequently, the initial masses involve a transition to single-phase gas flow and vacuum at the boundary. An appropriate balance between pressure and viscous forces is identified which allows obtaining pointwise upper and lower estimates of masses. These estimates rely on the assumption of a certain relation between the rate of degeneracy of the viscosity coefficient and the rate that determines how fast the initial masses are vanishing at the boundary. By combining these estimates with basic energy type of estimates, higher order regularity estimates are obtained. The existence of global weak solutions is then proved by showing compactness for a class of semi-discrete approximations.},

Interesting convergence results of these errors and of the remainder of the expansion allow us to determine sharp error bounds for stiff problems. As a representative example of stiff problems we have chosen the van der Pol equation. We illustrate that the theoretical prediction is confirmed by the numerical test. Specifically, an order reduction phenomenon is observed when the problem becomes increasingly stiff.

  abstract = {In this paper we consider hyperbolic systems with relaxation in which the relaxation time \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$ may vary from values of order one to very small values. When \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$ is very small, the relaxation term becomes very strong and highly stiff, and underresolved numerical schemes may produce spurious results. In such cases it is important to have schemes that work uniformly with respect to \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$. IMplicit-EXplicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta (R-K) schemes have been widely used for the time evolution of hyperbolic partial differential equations but the schemes existing in literature do not exhibit uniform accuracy with respect to the relaxation time. We develop new IMEX R-K schemes for hyperbolic systems with relaxation that present better uniform accuracy than the ones existing in the literature and in particular produce good behavior with high order accuracy in the asymptotic limit, i.e., when \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$ is very small. These schemes are obtained by imposing new additional order conditions to guarantee better accuracy over a wide range of the relaxation time. We propose the construction of new third-order IMEX R-K schemes of type CK [S. Boscarino, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 45 (2008), pp. 1600–1621]. In several test problems, these schemes, with a fixed spatial discretization, exhibit for all range of the relaxation time an almost uniform third-order accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper presents test cases, methodologies, and test results from the extensive testing and qualification program that have been conducted with LedaFlow®. This new transient multiphase flowline simulator has been built with focus on multiphase flow challenges in the oil and gas industry, and the resulting software includes both transient 1D and quasi 3D multiphase models. Development has been based both on existing and new large-scale experimental data from the SINTEF multiphase laboratory, taken over a nearly ten-year period. The focus of this paper is the transient 1D model.
 
The transient three-phase 1D simulator offers new modeling capabilities as it is based on a model concept conserving mass for 9 fields (bubbles, droplets, and continuous fluids), using three momentum equations, and solving for the enthalpy and temperature of the three individual fluid zones. Improved closure relations have been built from a combination of new large-scale multiphase flow experiments and sub-models which represents the distribution of droplets over the pipe cross section.
 
Before introduction of this new tool to the industry, it was taken through an extensive testing and qualification program. The testing included comparison with experimental data (over 10,000 experimental points) and field data (over a dozen pipelines and wells, from wet-gas to oil), as well as comparisons to other commercially available software. Another part of the testing was focused on typical flow assurance user cases; transient simulations such as turn-down, shut-down, start-up and depressurization were run for a number of realistic field geometries.
 
The new multiphase flow simulator reproduces experimental data and field data within defined acceptance criteria. This new multiphase flow software can be used as an alternative to other commercially available software and as a valuable new tool for flow assurance work for field development, operational studies and decision support.},

A staggered mesh and a first order Eulerian implicit time integration method are applied. The PeTra code has been developed in C++ using object-oriented methods. A major feature in PeTra is an adaptive and moving grid together with a fully integrated slug/pig tracking model. The slug tracking model enables tracking of slug fronts and tails without numerical diffusion and provides direct information about slug lengths. The use of a moving grid improves and simplifies the modelling and numerical tracking of liquid slugs. The slug tracking model controls the grid movement and also adjusts the grid to be optimal at all times, based on a user given coarse initial grid.
 
This paper discusses the applied techniques in this novel code and compares its slug tracking capabilities with experimental data and field data.},

  abstract = {We study the limiting behavior of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws with stiff relaxation terms. Reduced systems, inviscid and viscous local conservation laws, and weakly nonlinear limits are derived through asymptotic expansions. An entropy condition is introduced for N × N systems that ensures the hyperbolicity of the reduced inviscid system. The resulting characteristic speeds are shown to be interlaced with those of the original system. Moreover, the first correction to the reduced system is shown to be dissipative. A partial converse is proved for 2 × 2 systems. This structure is then applied to study the convergence to the reduced dynamics for the 2 × 2 case.},

  doi = {10.1006/jcph.2001.6962},
  abstract = {In this paper we deal with the construction of hybrid flux-vector-splitting (FVS) schemes and flux-difference-splitting (FDS) schemes for a two-phase model for one-dimensional flow. The model consists of two mass conservation equations (one for each phase) and a common momentum equation. The complexity of this model, as far as numerical computation is concerned, is related to the fact that the flux cannot be expressed in terms of its conservative variables. This is the motivation for studying numerical schemes which are not based on (approximate) Riemann solvers and/or calculations of Jacobian matrix. This work concerns the extension of an FVS type scheme, a Van Leer type scheme, and an advection upstream splitting method (AUSM) type scheme to the current two-phase model. Our schemes are obtained through natural extensions of corresponding schemes studied by Y. Wada and M.-S. Liou (1997, SIAM J. Sci. Comput.18, 633–657) for Euler equations. We explore the various schemes for flow cases which involve both fast and slow transients. In particular, we demonstrate that the FVS scheme is able to capture fast-propagating acoustic waves in a monotone way, while it introduces an excessive numerical dissipation at volume fraction contact (steady and moving) discontinuities. On the other hand, the AUSM scheme gives accurate resolution of contact discontinuities but produces oscillatory approximations of acoustic waves. This motivates us to propose other hybrid FVS/FDS schemes obtained by removing numerical dissipation at contact discontinuities in the FVS and Van Leer schemes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology for constructing accurate and efficient hybrid central-upwind (HCU) type schemes for the numerical resolution of a two-fluid model commonly used by the nuclear and petroleum industry. Particularly, we propose a method which does not make use of any information about the eigenstructure of the Jacobian matrix of the model. The two-fluid model possesses a highly nonlinear pressure law. From the mass conservation equations we develop an evolution equation which describes how pressure evolves in time. By applying a quasi-staggered Lax-Friedrichs type discretization for this pressure equation together with a Modified Lax-Friedrich type discretization of the convective terms, we obtain a central type scheme which allows to cope with the nonlinearity (nonlinear pressure waves) of the two-fluid model in a robust manner. Then, in order to obtain an accurate resolution of mass fronts, we employ a modification of the convective mass fluxes by hybridizing the central type mass flux components with upwind type components. This hybridization is based on a splitting of the mass fluxes into components corresponding to the pressure and volume fraction variables, recovering an accurate resolution of a contact discontinuity. In the numerical simulations, the resulting HCU scheme gives results comparable to an approximate Riemann solver while being superior in efficiency. Furthermore, the HCU scheme yields better robustness than other popular Riemann-free upwind schemes.},

In this paper we investigate generalizations of a class of hybrid explicit-implicit numerical schemes [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 26 (2005), pp. 1449--1484], originally proposed for a two-fluid two-phase flow model. We here outline a framework for extending this class of schemes, denoted as WIMF (weakly implicit mixture flux), to other systems of conservation laws. We apply the strategy to a different two-phase flow model, the drift-flux model suitable for describing bubbly two-phase mixtures. Our analysis is based on a simplified formulation of the model, structurally similar to the Euler equations. The main underlying building block is a pressure-based implicit central scheme. Explicit upwind fluxes are incorporated, in a manner ensuring that upwind-type resolution is recovered for a simple contact discontinuity.
 
 
 
The derived scheme is then applied to the general drift-flux model. Numerical simulations demonstrate accuracy, efficiency and a satisfactory level of robustness. Particularly, it is demonstrated that the scheme outperforms an explicit Roe scheme in terms of efficiency and accuracy on slow mass-transport dynamics.},

  abstract = {Research in robust control theory has been one of the most active areas of mainstream systems theory since the late 70s. This research activity has been at the confluence of dynamical systems theory, functional analysis, matrix analysis, numerical methods, complexity theory, and engineering applications. The discipline has involved interactions between diverse research groups including pure mathematicians, applied mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers. This research effort has produced a rather extensive set of approaches using a wide variety of mathematical techniques, and applications of robust control theory are spreading to areas as diverse as control of fluids, power networks, and the investigation of feddback mechanisms in biology. During the 90's the theory has seen major advances and achieved a new maturity, centered around the notion of convexity. The goal of this book is to give a graduate-level course on robust control theory that emphasizes these new developments, but at the same time conveys the main principles and ubiquitous tools at the heart of the subject. Its pedagogical objectives are to introduce a coherent and unified framework for studying robust control theory, to provide students with the control-theoretic background required to read and contribute to the research literature, and to present the main ideas and demonstrations of the major results of robust control theory. The book will be of value to mathematical researchers and computer scientists wishing to learn about robust control theory, graduate students planning to do research in the area, and engineering practitioners requiring advanced control techniques.},

  abstract = {The possibility of performing data assimilation using the flow-dependent statistics calculated from an ensemble of short-range forecasts (a technique referred to as ensemble Kalman filtering) is examined in an idealized environment. Using a three-level, quasigeostrophic, T21 model and simulated observations, experiments are performed in a perfect-model context. By using forward interpolation operators from the model state to the observations, the ensemble Kalman filter is able to utilize nonconventional observations.

In order to maintain a representative spread between the ensemble members and avoid a problem of inbreeding, a pair of ensemble Kalman filters is configured so that the assimilation of data using one ensemble of short-range forecasts as background fields employs the weights calculated from the other ensemble of short-range forecasts. This configuration is found to work well: the spread between the ensemble members resembles the difference between the ensemble mean and the true state, except in the case of the smallest ensembles.

A series of 30-day data assimilation cycles is performed using ensembles of different sizes. The results indicate that (i) as the size of the ensembles increases, correlations are estimated more accurately and the root-mean-square analysis error decreases, as expected, and (ii) ensembles having on the order of 100 members are sufficient to accurately describe local anisotropic, baroclinic correlation structures. Due to the difficulty of accurately estimating the small correlations associated with remote observations, a cutoff radius beyond which observations are not used, is implemented. It is found that (a) for a given ensemble size there is an optimal value of this cutoff radius, and (b) the optimal cutoff radius increases as the ensemble size increases.},

However, the test problem was the two-dimensional heat equation, a problem in which the physics dominates the system in such a way that controller efficacy is difficult to generalize.

For several physically relevant problems the observer gains are obtained in closed form. The observer gains are then used for an output-feedback design in both collocated and anti-collocated setting of sensor and actuator. The order of the resulting compensator can be substantially lowered without affecting stability. Explicit solutions of a closed loop system are found in particular cases.},

  abstract = {Many real-time decision support systems for drilling operations, or advanced drilling control systems, are based on computer models calculating wellbore pressure and mechanical forces on the drillstring. Closed loop control systems, for example for Managed Pressure Drilling, or advanced offshore or onshore decision support systems are examples of systems that may involve such real-time calculations. To obtain a high degree of accuracy in these calculations it is crucial that all parameters describing the system are as correct as possible. Uncertain model parameters may be tuned against measurements. Both surface measurements, like standpipe pressure, hook load and torque, and downhole pressure from Measurement While Drilling tool may be used.

Recently, a field trial of such a real-time system with advanced computer models has been performed during a drilling operation in the North Sea. An advanced drilling control system were implemented and tested. The control system includes real-time calculation of both hydraulics and mechanical forces. Key model parameters were tuned using different estimation techniques.

The presented methodology for calibration of real-time computer models lead to a more accurate estimation of the status of the well flow and the stresses on the drill-string compared to standard methods, which may be crucial for the performance of real-time decision support systems or advanced drilling control systems. The performance of the calibration methods is studied using results from the North Sea drilling operation. Although the presented results are obtained from a conventional drilling operation this methodology has a broad range of applications. Benefits by this approach are seen by more accurate calculations of downhole hydraulics and stress which are of major importance for safety and economic reasons during drilling operations involving real-time decision support systems or advanced drilling control systems.

In the near future application of wired pipe technology will supply advanced real-time systems with more reliable downhole measurements and the possibility of distributed sensors. Given the appropriate calibration techniques, this step-changing technology will lead to better accuracy of estimated state and also forward simulations.},

  abstract = {An essential part of an automated managed-pressure-drilling (MPD) control system is the hydraulics model, which, in many cases, is the limiting factor for achievable accuracy of the system. Much effort, therefore, has been put into developing advanced hydraulics models that capture all aspects of the drilling-fluid hydraulics. However, a main drawback is the resulting complexity of these models, which require expert knowledge to set up and calibrate, making it a high-end solution.

In practice, much of the complexity does not contribute to improvement of the overall accuracy of the pressure estimate simply because conditions in the well change during MPD operations and there are not enough measurements to keep all of the parameters of an advanced model calibrated.

We will demonstrate that a simplified hydraulics model based on basic fluid dynamics is able to capture the dominating hydraulics of an MPD system. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that, by applying algorithms for online parameter estimation similar to those used in advanced control systems in the automotive and aerospace industry, the model can be calibrated automatically by use of existing measurements to achieve a level of accuracy comparable with that of a calibrated advanced hydraulics model. The results are demonstrated using field data from MPD operations in the North Sea and dedicated experiments obtained at a full-scale drilling rig in Stavanger.},

  abstract = {FlowManager Dynamic is a transient multiphase flow simulator for online surveillance, optimization and prediction of subsea oil and gas production. The simulator covers all operational scenarios (e.g. production, shut-in, restart) for a complete subsea field layout (reservoir, wells, pipelines, subsea process equipment). This paper focuses on prediction of multiphase flow in wells and pipelines.
 
The simulator is based on models that are fast, robust, simplified and highly tuneable, but valid for all operational conditions. The model for wells and pipelines is a 1-D drift flux model with algebraic slip and friction relations for all flow regimes. All friction and slip relations, and the transition between flow regimes, are continuous and smooth for robustness, easy tuning and optimization. The equations are solved numerically using the Strongly Implicit Mixture Flux (SIMF) method developed by Evje and Flåtten (1). SIMF is a fast and robust numerical method that ensures accurate resolution of liquid slugs and surges.
 
Network calculations, rate allocation and tuning are performed using multivariable optimization, ensuring consistency between all variables (flow rates, pressures, temperatures, tuning factors). The unique combination of multivariable optimization and fast, smooth and robust models enables simple and fast tuning and adjustment to measurements. This unique feature strongly reduces the configuration complexity compared to other simulators where controllers in combination with artificial pressure drop and temperature sources (e.g. valves, heat exchangers or tuning factors) are used to adjust the model to measurements.
 
FlowManager Dynamic agrees well with experimental data and data from the FlowManager field database. In this paper, the strengths of the simulator are demonstrated on an existing field application. It is shown that the simulator is easy to tune and gives accurate predictions of flow rates, pressure drop and liquid surges.},

creates a huge amount of small files when performing large parallel simulations.
An alternative storage strategy using the HDFS library to store the data in one single file is presented.
The implementation is created as a plugin, and no changes to the OpenFOAM code is needed. The
write operations are performed in parallel using MPl-10. A real-life example is presented in which
the original storage strategy makes the simulation impossible to perform. The proposed new format
reduce the number of files from 7 .26 millions to one single file, and is required in order to be able
to process the data from the simulations.},

  abstract = {We give an overview on the usage of computer simulations in industrial
turbulent dispersed multiphase flows. We present a few examples of industrial flows:
bubble columns and bubbly pipe flows, stirred tanks, cyclones, and a fluid catalytic
cracking unit. The fluid catalytic cracking unit is used to illustrate the complexity of
the physical phenomena involved, and the possibilities and limitations of the different
approaches used: Eulerian–Lagrangian (particle-tracking) and Eulerian–Eulerian
(two-fluid). In the first approach, the continuous phase is solved using either RANS
simulations (Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes simulations) or DNS/LES (Direct
Numerical Simulations/Large-Eddy Simulations), and the individual particles are
tracked. In the second approach, the dispersed phase is averaged, leading to two
sets equations, which are quite similar to the RANS equations of single-phase flows.
The Eulerian–Eulerian approach is the most commonly used in industrial applications,
however, it requires a significant amount of modelling. Eulerian–Lagrangian
RANS can be simpler to use; in particular in situations involving complex boundary
conditions, polydisperse flows and agglomeration/breakup. The key issue for the
success of the simulations is to have good models for the complex physics involved.
A major weakness is the lack of good models for: the turbulence modification
promoted by the particles, the inter-particle interactions, and the near-wall effects.
Eulerian–Lagrangian DNS/LES can play an important role as a research tool, in
order to get a better physical understanding, and to improve the models used in the
RANS simulations (either Eulerian–Eulerian or Eulerian–Lagrangian).},

  abstract = {The objective of ASME V V 20 is the specification of a verification and validation approach that quantifies the degree of accuracy inferred from the comparison of solution and data for a specified variable at a specified validation point.  The approach uses the concepts from experimental uncertainty analysis to consider the errors and uncertainties in both the solution and the data.

The scope of this Standard is the quantification of the degree of accuracy of simulation of specified validation variables at a specified validation point for cases in which the conditions of the actual experiment are simulated.  Consideration of solution accuracy at points within a domain other than the validation points, for example interpolation/extrapolation in a domain of validation, is a matter of engineering judgment specific to each family of problems and is beyond the scope of this Standard.

ASME’s growing portfolio of V\&V standards now become essential resources and references for anyone engaged with computational modeling.

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an emerging technology. It is the merger of the classical branches of theoretical and experimental science, with the infusion of the modern element of numerical computation. The progress in CFD during the last 40 years has been extraordinary. Much of this progress has been driven by the phenomenal increases in digital computing speed. The cost of computation has decreased roughly five orders of magnitude since 1955 [1]. The power of digital computing has transformed research and engineering in fluid mechanics, just as it has in virtually all fields of human endeavor.},

  title = {Best {{Practice Guidelines Industrial Computational Fluid Dynamics}} of {{Single}}-{{Phase Flows}}},
  edition = {1},
  url = {http://www.ercoftac.org/publications/ercoftac_best_practice_guidelines/single-phase_flows_spf/},
  abstract = {Overview

The Best Practice Guidelines (BPG) were commissioned by ERCOFTAC following an extensive consultation with European industry which revealed an urgent demand for such a document. The first edition was completed in January 2000 and constitutes generic advice on how to carry out quality CFD calculations. The BPG  address:

    mesh design;
    construction of numerical boundary conditions where problem data is uncertain;
    mesh and model sensitivity checks;
    distinction between numerical and turbulence model inadequacy;
    preliminary information regarding the limitations of turbulence models etc. 

The aim is to encourage a common best practice by virtue of which separate analyses of the same problem, using the same model physics, should produce consistent results. Input and advice was sought from a wide cross-section of CFD specialists, eminent academics, end-users and, (particularly important) the leading commercial code vendors established in Europe. Thus, the final document can be considered to represent the consensus view of the European CFD community.

Inevitably, the Guidelines cannot cover every aspect of CFD in detail. They are intended to offer roughly those 20\% of the most important general rules of advice that cover roughly 80\% of the problems likely to be encountered. As such, they constitute essential information for the novice user and provide a basis for quality management and regulation of safety submissions which rely on CFD. Experience has also shown that they can often provide useful advice for the more experienced user.
Content 

The technical content is limited to single-phase, compressible and incompressible, steady and unsteady, turbulent and laminar flow with and without heat transfer. Versions which are customised to other aspects of CFD (the remaining 20\% of problems) are planned for the future.

The seven principle chapters of the document address:

    numerical, convergence and round-off errors;
    turbulence modelling;
    application uncertainties;
    user errors;
    code errors;
    validation and sensitivity tests for CFD models
    examples of the BPG applied in practice. 

In the first six of these each of the different sources of error and uncertainty are examined and discussed, including references to important books, articles and reviews. Following the discussion sections, short simple bullet-point statements of advice are listed which provide clear guidance and are easily understandable without elaborate mathematics.

All such statements of advice are gathered together at the end of the document to provide a ‘Best Practice Checklist’. The chapter 'Examples' provides detailed expositions of eight test cases each one calculated by a code vendor (viz FLUENT, AEA Technology, Computational Dynamics, NUMECA) or code developer (viz Electricité de France, CEA, British Energy) and each of which highlights one or more specific points of advice arising in the BPG. These test cases range from natural convection in a cavity through to flow in a low speed centrifugal compressor and in an internal combustion engine valve.},

  abstract = {In this general lecture, we shall first outline the way computational non-Newtonian fluid mechanics differs from conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We do this by briefly outlining the major historical developments in this relatively new field of science, which is conveniently called Computational Rheology. To illustrate essential features, we limit the discussion to the Oldroyd B, UCM and Phan-Thien/Tanner constitutive models. In order to provide a serious challenge to existing numerical codes, we describe some recent unpublished experimental results on flow through a contraction of constant viscosity (Boger) and also shear-thinning elastic liquids. Both planar and axisymmetric contractions are of interest, and pressure drops and observed flow structures provide the relevant points of contact between experiment and numerical prediction. Numerical codes developed at UWS involving a hybrid finite-element/finite-volume scheme for Oldroyd B and Phan-Thien/Tanner constitutive models are applied to the contraction-flow problems and an encouraging agreement is demonstrated between theory and experiment. Specifically, the dramatic experimental differences between flow in planar and axisymmetric contractions and between constant viscosity and shear-thinning polymer solutions are mirrored in the numerical predictions, at least in a qualitative sense. Notwithstanding these encouraging developments, the review ends with a realistic assessment of the challenges still awaiting computational rheologists, with particular reference to the choice of constitutive model and the possibility of further refinements to the numerical techniques.

The review is particularly focused on Na+-montmorillonite clay of the smectite group (Bentonite), due to its high swelling capacity, the ability to adsorb significant amounts of polymer on its surfaces, and the formation of a gel-like structure with yield characteristics and viscoelastic properties at relatively low clay concentrations. A significant amount of research has been performed in these areas with applicability to various fields, such as soil science and drilling fluids, where interaction of organic polymers with the clay surface and the rheological response in the presence of electrolytes under different temperature and pressure conditions are of considerable relevance. In order to understand the interaction of these compounds with the clay surface and the rheological response of the resulting suspensions, it becomes essential to understand the structure of clay minerals, the interaction of clay particles in aqueous medium, the swelling behaviour and electrokinetic properties of Na+-montmorillonite clay. For this reason, the above topics are addressed, along with the general features of stabilisation of colloidal particles and the adsorption mechanism of non-ionic compounds on hydrophilic surfaces. A comprehensive review of the most relevant studies of the adsorption of non-ionic surfactants and polymers onto both silica and clay is presented. Finally, an overview of the rheological behaviour of concentrated suspensions and models used to describe the flow behaviour of clay suspensions is given, along with the effect of electrolytes, polymers, high pressure and high temperature on the flow behaviour of Na+-montmorillonite suspensions.},

  abstract = {Publication Rights Reserved Abstract One aspect of rock penetration which has received attention in the Rock Mechanics Laboratory at Penn State has been drag-bit drilling, a subject of some interest to the petroleum. industry. This paper presents the results of the second research investigation conducted in this area. Experimental design and interpretation of the findings were conducted with the aid of dimensional analysis, programmed for solution on an IBM 7074 digital computer. Certain groups of dimensionless parameters were developed which permitted the effect and the interaction of several operational variables to be analyzed with a limited number of laboratory experiments. These parameters related such factors as rotary speed, bit weight, distance drilled, bit clearance angle, circulation rate, bit wear, bit temperature and penetration rate--which were then investigated on a laboratory drill press using a drag bit of one- half-inch cutting edge drilling in Pennsylvania slate. The experiments were concerned principally with two independent variables in separate tests: bit clearance angle and fluid circulation rate. Over a range of 5, 15 and 25-degree clearance angles, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Penetration rate varies directly with bit clearance angle and with thrust. 2. Bit wear measured by weight loss varies directly with clearance angle but, measured by width of flat, varies inversely. Over a range of circulation rates of 2 to 4 cu ft/ min and. 1/2 to 2 gal/min water, these findings were obtained for bits of various hard-metal compositions. 1. Bit temperature increases as the flow rate decreases, accompanied by a corresponding increase in bit wear and decrease in penetration rate. 2. An attempt to correlate this effect with the physico-thermal properties of the bits failed to yield significant results. 5. For a given circulation rate, the temperature gradient across the cutting edge of a drag bit increases with penetration rate. Certain observations are also reported regarding the nature of cutting action, rock failure and bit wear in drag-bit drilling. Introduction Penetration rate and bit wear, the factors on which the successful performance and economy of a drilling operation essentially depend, have long been the object of improvement through drilling research and development. Two of the more important factors known to influence drilling performance are bit geometry and the flushing or circulation system. The present research was devoted primarily to an investigation of the effects of bit clearance angle and bit temperature, as affected by flushing medium and flow rate, in rock drilling employing drag-bit cutting. This form of mechanical attack is attracting increased attention in both mining and petroleum circles, although drag-bit drilling has as yet been little researched. In the mining literature, bit clearance angle has been the subject in several studies of the effect of bit geometry on penetration rate and bit wear. Fairhurst derived a general formula for the minimum clearance angle as where is clearance angle, p is penetration per revolution, and r is distance from the axis of rotation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Hole cleaning (cuttings transport) is a major concern and challenge while drilling inclined wells. Insufficient hole cleaning can cause several costly problems, such as an increase in ECD, excessive torque and drag, pack-off, cementing problems, stuck pipe, etc. The physics of particle cuttings flow is very complicated, and it is impossible to accurately predict the cuttings flow with many different particles, differing in size, shape and density, in non-Newtonian fluids with multiple flow regimes. The Critical Transport Fluid Velocity (CTFV) is the minimum fluid flow velocity in a pipe or annular region required to prevent the formation of a stationary cuttings bed. This paper will show that the determination of the CTFV for inclined wellbores is, for the most part, dependent on simple geometrical parameters and on fluid and cuttings parameters. This paper is the result of a study to determine the most significant physical phenomena involved in establishing the CTFV. The governing equations discussed in this paper have been tested against the measurements of Thor Inge F. Larsen published in his Master's Thesis at the University of Tulsa in 1990. The results presented in this paper will show that physics based equations can replace many of the correlations suggested by Larsen. The paper also shows that the same geometrical considerations are governing the changes in CTFV as the inner and outer diameters of the wellbore changes. We will show that one consequence of this is that using only the pipe hydraulic diameter, i.e. the difference in the inside and outside diameters in the annular region, is not sufficient in determining the change in CTFV as the pipe diameters change. Suggestions for further experiments and necessary measurements in order to improve the accuracy are presented.},

The two fluid model (TFM) closed by the kinetic theory of granular flows (KTGF) has been developed to a high level of maturity over the past three decades. However, significant uncertainties still remain about the influence of various closure models on the predictions of the hydrodynamics and especially the reactive performance of fluidised bed reactors. The three factors investigated in this study – frictional pressure, geometry (2D/3D) and friction at the walls – all have significant influences on model predictions of the behaviour of a pseudo-2D bubbling fluidised bed reactor. This study aims to quantify the influence of these important factors on simulation output both in terms of hydrodynamics and reactive performance. Simulations designed to evaluate the effects of these factors were carried out over a wide range of fluidisation velocities, bed loadings and particle sizes to reveal significant impacts on the results. Differences in simulation results varied significantly with changes in the three operating variables investigated (fluidisation velocity, bed loading and particle size) and were analysed in detail. Finally, 3D simulations with wall friction and frictional pressure included showed qualitatively very similar hydrodynamic behaviour to that observed in the experiments. Quantitatively, measurements of the bed expansion ratio compared well for different fluidisation velocities and the particle sizes, but some unexplained differences were still observed in response to changes in the bed loading.},

  abstract = {Abstract The process of drilling a borehole is very complex, involving surface and downhole drilling systems, which interact with the drilling fluid and the surrounding rocks. Modeling and simulating every aspect of the drilling process and drilling system is still considered too complex to be realized. However, many areas of modeling and simulation are currently undergoing very aggressive development. These areas include rig systems, downhole dynamics, rock-bit interaction, drilling/formation fluid, and the Earth model. High-fidelity models in these well-defined areas have demonstrated some success. Lately, drilling modelling and simulation has become one of the key factors for advancing drilling systems automation/control, intelligent managed pressure drilling and drilling optimization by understanding and/or predicting downhole dynamics. Modeling the magnitude and spatiotemporal distribution of uncertainty in the actual drilling process poses serious challenges in constructing high-fidelity models of the entire drilling system. However, the advancement of technology may dramatically improve the future of such an attempt to accurately model and simulate the whole drilling process. The topics presented in this paper include the current state of drilling process simulation software and simulators, the challenges of modelling drilling systems for automation and control, adaptive simulations for downhole drilling systems and the operator's perspective on drilling modelling. This paper examines the current state of drilling modelling and simulation and identifies its future goals.},

Early indications of hole cleaning problems were observed both on temperature and pressure. Calculations predict that downhole temperature is very flow regime dependent, and flow regime depends on eccentricity of the inner string, which therefore is important to take into account. It is also demonstrated that the presence of tool joints may influence temperature dramatically.

Improvements in the planning and modeling of the drilling of extended reach wells are suggested.},

  title = {Automation of Mud-Pump Management Application to Drilling Operations in the North-Sea},
  volume = {26},
  abstract = {Drilling in the North Sea is confronted with an ever more challenging pressure-management issue because of narrow geopressure windows in depleted reservoirs. Further, the occurrence of packoffs can cause serious damage to the formation and contribute to nonproductive time. To address these problems, automation of mud-pump management has been developed over the last 4 years to minimize the chance of fracturing the formation while starting the mud pumps or circulating. To account for abnormal flow restrictions in the annulus, automatic actions are also an integral part of the mud-pump automation described in this paper.

Since the downhole conditions are continuously changing (e.g., depth, temperature, flow-rate, gel time, cuttings proportion), the necessary safeguards to operate the mud pumps need to be updated constantly. Advanced transient temperature and hydraulic models are used to estimate, in real-time, the downhole situation. On the basis of the current context, evaluations of maximum pump rates and acceptable flow accelerations are performed and sent to the mud-pump control system to be used as an envelope of protection. Furthermore, to assist the driller during connections, the pump-startup procedure has been semiautomated to decrease connection time. Finally, an automatically triggered pump-shutdown procedure is also available to minimize the consequences of a packoff on formation fracturing.

A first version of the system has been tested during the drilling of one well in 2008 in the North Sea. Based on the initial experience, a revised version has been used during the drilling of three wells drilled on the Norwegian continental shelf in 2009. The feedback from the drillers involved in the testing has been used to improve the user friendliness of the system. The automation of the mud-pump management has been well accepted by the drilling crews. However, the testing has shown that additional instrumentation at the rigsite is necessary before such automation can be rolled out safely.},

  abstract = {This work studies reduced order modeling (ROM) approaches to speed up the solution of variational data assimilation problems with large scale nonlinear dynamical models. It is shown that a key requirement for a successful reduced order solution is that reduced order Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions accurately represent their full order counterparts. In particular, accurate reduced order approximations are needed for the forward and adjoint dynamical models, as well as for the reduced gradient. New strategies to construct reduced order based are developed for proper orthogonal decomposition(POD) ROM data assimilation using both Galerkin and Petrov–Galerkin projections. For the first time POD, tensorial POD, and discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) are employed to develop reduced data assimilation systems for a geophysical flow model, namely, the two dimensional shallow water equations. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical framework for Galerkin projection. In the case of Petrov–Galerkin projection, stabilization strategies must be considered for the reduced order models. The new reduced order shallow water data assimilation system provides analyses similar to those produced by the full resolution data assimilation system in one tenth of the computational time.},

  title = {Toward Drilling Automation: {{On}} the Necessity of Using Sensors That Relate to Physical Models},
  url = {https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-163440-MS},
  abstract = {Current top-side and downhole instrumentation at the well site has been developed for the purpose of manually conducted drilling operations. The emergence of automatic drilling analysis software shows the limitations of today's measurements capabilities. It is therefore time to analyze the requirements for onsite instrumentation in order to implement new, efficient drilling automation technologies.

On one hand, drilling is facing more and more difficult conditions with narrow geo-pressure windows, deep water or high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions. On the other hand, unconventional hydrocarbon reserves may require a considerable amount of wells to be profitable. Drilling automation, by means of smart safeguards, automatic safety triggers, managed pressure drilling (MPD) and ultimately complete or semi-autonomous drilling rigs can provide the solution to safely construct wells in these challenging settings.

The common denominator for the vast majority of drilling automation solutions is the use of physical models of the drilling process in the form of heat transfer, mechanical and hydraulic models. By analyzing the requirements of those models for necessary boundary conditions, it is possible to derive which measurements should be made both at surface and downhole in order to obtain stable and accurate calculations. This analysis also provides a way to estimate the necessary accuracy of the boundary conditions to ensure reaching the target control tolerance.

Using the boundary condition analysis, it is possible to derive precisely which measurements should be done and where they should be performed. As a result, a typical organization of sensors that is compatible with the implementation of drilling automation solutions is derived.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of a drilling operation is to a great extent governed by how well one is able to optimize the rate of penetration (ROP) throughout each stage of the operation. ROP optimization normally involves balancing drilling speed on the one hand with acceptable wear to the drill bit on the other. The bit lifetime is largely determined by the mechanical conditions at the bit-formation rock interface and the weight on bit (WOB) and torque on bit (TOB) provide important information related to the working condition of the bit. The accuracy of WOB and TOB measurements can thus become a determining factor for the overall drilling efficiency.

Due to the low bandwidth of downhole mud pulse-based telemetry systems, the WOB and the TOB are generally derived from surface measurements, i.e. from the hook load and the top-drive torque. Field experience indicates that a WOB derived from surface measurements can be of limited accuracy, such as when surface measurements suggest a negative WOB even though the ROP is positive, or when high sampling rate and high precision downhole measurements confirm a large discrepancy between the memory recorded downhole data and the estimated values based on the measurements made at the level of the hoisting equipment and the top-drive.

The reason for these inconsistencies is simply that there are numerous physical processes taking place between the bit and the surface measurements that are normally not accounted for when WOB and TOB are estimated. This paper reviews and analyses the sources of these deviations and models the physical processes in order to quantify the precision for which the WOB and the TOB can be ascertained using solely surface measurements. Methods are also proposed that compensate for certain side effects by utilizing real-time torque and drag and hydraulic calculations.},

Typically, data from service companies is transmitted from the rig to the clients Real Time Operating Centre (RTOC).  A major problem is the quality of this data, which can lead to incorrect analysis and a breakdown in trust between the rig and the RTOC. Currently real time data is, at best, only checked for completeness.

In this work, we present a model for data quality control in real-time operating centres. The following points are considered in our suggested model:

1. Monitoring the quality of real time data for: Completeness, Continuity, Timeliness, Validity, Accuracy, Consistency, Integrity.
2. Alarming of all unexpected data;
3. Generating daily data quality reports.

 

The suggested data quality control model has different groups of key performance indicators, calculated in real time from the streamed data. The model then takes the values of these performance indicators as input, and evaluates different properties of data quality as the output. Additionally, a new group of intelligent model-based key performance indicators is suggested. These indicators give the possibility to monitor actual quality and measure it against the expected one. The result is a measurement of Quality of Service (QoS) supplied by data provider at the rig.},

  abstract = {The amount of data collected in the information age has grown to amounts barely manageable. Currently available technologies are already capable of transmitting the readings of any sensor to worldwide locations at high frequencies and with nearly no time delay. With an ever-increasing flow of data, the need for criteria to measure and evaluate data quality are more pressing than ever, as this data forms the basis for many critical business decisions. This paper addresses these problems and shows essential steps to a successful data and quality management strategy: Quality control and improvement, Data quality benchmarking, Accessibility of controlled data.

Simple but very effective signal processing algorithms are presented to ensure that the data is in the right value range, outliers are removed and missing values are substituted where possible. More complex control instances may not be able to correct data completely by automation. Here the human expert is still necessary for corrections. To minimize the work for engineers, a processing engine produces smart alarms whenever an automated data correction is not possible. If no correction is possible at all, the questionable portion of the data must be flagged invalid, or even be deleted to prevent misuse and wrong conclusions. This may be dependent on the application; so good data management is essential to provide a minimum standard for each individual case.
The final step is to publish and present the data at the correct level of detail to different parts of the corporation. Key in this procedure is that every individual has easy and fast access to the data for their decision-making. In this context, the appropriate resolution, as well as the most efficient use of data processing time, is of critical interest. A unique solution to browse large volumes of drilling data is presented.},

framework with focus on information

propose a schema for defining meta-data for possible 
standardization for the Multiscale Cluster/ICMEg consortium. Within the NanoSim consortium, WP1 deals with 
defining a framework (Porto) for connecting and utilizing software simulators of different scales through offline-coupling. The focus of engineering applications within the NanoSim project is fluidized beds. For such large-scale 
applications the most promising multi-scale simulation strategy is to focus on representative elements of the 
simulation domain, resolving these representative elements on a small scale, and feed the result into a sub-grid 
model on the next larger scale. Within NanoSim, the following 6 scales are accounted for:
1. System scale, simulated by a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs),
2. Equipment scale, simulated by Large Scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulations,
3. Cluster scale, simulated by coupled CFD DEM (Discrete Element) simulations,
4. Particle scale, simulated by CFD-DEM simulations and CFD/DNS (Direct Numerical) Simulations,
5. Intra-particle pore scale, simulated by Intra-Particle simulation coupled to CFD-DEM and
6. Atomistic scale, simulated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Kinetic Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations.

Porto serves to connect the different simulators, which is a nonhomogenous set of in-house, open source and proprietary simulators, running on different operating systems. The complexity and diversity of such a system 
requires that we have formal schemas and structures of meta-data that allows for information interpretation 
regardless of the original storage format and application. Porto offers the possibility to utilize MongoDB for meta-data and data storage, with features such as load balancing, data replication over multiple machines, map-reduce

The starting point for most companies in using WITSML is to bring depth data into their asset databases.  For many this has become the norm. Early adopters like Statoil are broadening their use into a wider range of wellsite operations. Within asset teams a standard data delivery mechanism allows integration of new tools and workflows, letting Geologists and Engineers make use of real-time data within their familiar desktop applications.  It also enables centrally managed data delivery services letting them focus on their areas of expertise, not data gathering.

New technology and processes in these areas are helping operators make the next big step from real-time remote monitoring to real-time remote control.
For growing numbers it is now not enough to receive a visual representation of the data.  They expect data to be delivered in real-time via a standard format.

WITSML also brings operators the opportunity to standardize data delivery workflows, to clarify contractual requirements to providers and to establish and measure realistic data delivery KPIs.

Within Schlumberger WITSML enabled workflows are well established, answer products for drilling optimization and interpretation utilize the standard via a unified WITSML client. This reduces software development cycle time and simplifies data gathering.

WITSML is becoming established, bringing proven advantages to real-time workflows. Continued uptake of the standard will enhance the competitive advantage of service companies and the operators utilizing it. WITSML is here to stay and should be supported more widely within the industry.},

  doi = {10.2118/167873-MS},
  abstract = {The Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Language (WITSML) is a Global Standard for transmitting GeoTechnical Data from the Wellsite to Operator Offices

Saudi Aramco have embarked upon a project to implement the transfer and storage of all wellsite real time data using the WITSML 1.4.1 Specification. This project is called the Real Time Data Transmission and Viewer Service (RTDTVS). Through this project all Rig Real Time Data is being captured and transmitted back to the Drilling Real Time Data Hub (DRTDH), which is run on an Oracle platform with triple redundancy.
Drilling Sensor data has usually not in the past been transmitted back for monitoring purposes, and instead the Operator has left the Drilling contractor to manage the drilling process, and relied upon the Mudlogging Contractor to provide notifications when a situation occurs on the Wellsite. However, on most Development wells the Mudlogging services are not used, making the capture of the drilling sensor data vital not only for Safety Monitoring, but also to ensure the Optimisation of the drilling parameters to reduce well drilling costs.
In order to make accurate calculations of many drilling performance indexes it is necessary to have access to some information that is typically not transmitted as part of a Real Time data stream, but is available instead through the Daily reporting mechanisms.This Paper discussed how through the use of WITSML it has enabled Drilling Sensor Data to be integrated with the Report Data available through the Saudi Aramco Drilling Knowledge Database (SADK) in order to provide more efficient and safe drilling practices},

  doi = {10.2118/123208-MS},
  abstract = {BP has developed an internal Recommended Practice for the deployment of a standard data architecture for real-time drilling and completions information.  This architecture uses WITSML communications as much as possible although data aggregation on the drilling rig can still employ WITS, OPC or even a proprietary language.  Most deployments in BP are built on the latest Version 1.3.1 of WITSML.  Early deployments in Indonesia revealed some inter-operability problems which had to be resolved quickly to eliminate operational delays.  This experience highlighted the value of pre-deployment testing and subsequent deployments have all been staged in an independent test facility hosted for BP by SAIC in Aberdeen.

The BP WITSML test laboratory has already staged drilling and completions data systems for BP businesses in Gulf of Mexico, UK North Sea and Oman prior to field deployments.  In addition, the Business Units have also been keen for the laboratory to provide an operational support function post deployment.  Testing has also been conducted in conjunction with main BP equipment suppliers to demonstrate compliance for future installations.

Various problems have been identified during testing which will be described in the paper.  The value of identifying these problems in a laboratory environment, rather than potentially exposing drilling operations to delays during equipment commissioning, is very considerable.  The testing has been conducted with a very positive commitment from our suppliers which has resulted in significant learnings for all parties.

BP, along with other major energy companies, sees WITSML as an important enabler for remote operations, collaboration environments and the deployment of new technologies to support its future drilling and completions operations.  The WITSML laboratory testing has been a critical step in building confidence in the robustness of WITSML and demonstrating its performance capabilities.},

  abstract = {In the quest of increasing production capacity to meet future demands E\&P companies have embarked in the journey of re-developing their matured assets. This is enabled using several field development programmes that include in-fill drilling, horizontal drilling, underbalanced drilling and drilling unconventional reservoirs. These programmes require high quality offset well data along with real time data for better planning and execution to successfully manage drilling risk, reduce non-productive time and cost to achieve the field development objective.

Historically a huge volume of operational data has been acquired from the large number of wells drilled. Data include well trajectories, casing points, casing analysis, drilling risks, drilling events, BHA performance, operational window, cost, time etc. Maintaining the historical offset drilling data systematically in a well organized manner is vital to unlock its business value and enable better drilling data analysis along with real time data. Technology aided programs such as collaborative well planning, geo steering, real time operations center, require offset well data integrated into real time data for integrated and optimized workflows during planning and execution. This includes building better engineering models and earth models.

This paper discuss present data challenges and the approach towards building an Drilling Integrated Workflow Environment (DIWE)  comprising of high quality drilling knowledge base, real time data enabled by data standards and the framework to support next generation well planning and drilling workflows.

DIWE enables improved planning and execution by supporting integrated workflows that aim to mitigate drilling hazards, improve operational awareness, optimize well design, cost effective construction, and better well placement moving towards achieving drilling excellence},

  doi = {10.1137/050633482},
  abstract = {We explore the relationship between two common two‐phase flow models, usually denoted as the two‐fluid and drift‐flux models. They differ in their mathematical description of momentum transfer between the phases. In this paper we provide a framework in which these two model formulations are unified. The drift‐flux model employs a mixture momentum equation and treats interphasic momentum exchange indirectly through the slip relation, which gives the relative velocity between the phases as a function of the flow parameters. This closure law is in general highly complex, which makes it difficult to analyze the model algebraically. To facilitate the analysis, we express the quasi‐linear formulation of the drift‐flux model as a function of three parameters: the derivatives of the slip with respect to the vector of unknown variables. The wave structure of this model is investigated using a perturbation technique. Then we rewrite the drift‐flux model with a general slip relation such that it is expressed in terms of the canonical two‐fluid form. That is, we replace the mixture momentum equation and the slip relation with equivalent evolution equations for the momentums of each phase. We obtain a mathematically equivalent formulation in terms of a two‐fluid model and by this bridge some of the gap between the drift‐flux model and the two‐fluid model. Finally, the effect of the various exchange terms on the wave structure of the two‐fluid model is investigated.},

  abstract = {Abstract Due to the recent drop in the oil prices, the oil and gas industry is experiencing tremendous pressures to reduce costs. This is especially true for both Subsea Production Systems (SPS) development and operations to ensure profitability while meeting increasing regulatory requirements. In the last years, the modelling and simulation of multiphase flows has become a powerful engineering tool to conduct virtual experiments during design and development for many industries, such as aerospace, automotive, energy and healthcare. This is mainly due to the significant improvement of the modelling approaches which include more details of multiphase flow physics and phenomena. An additional growth contribution is due to the rapid development of the computational resources and computer power. The oil and gas industry can benefit from high fidelity multiphase flow modelling and simulation tools to minimize the cost of production system design during the project development phase as well as to support optimized operation and assessment of production performance. Because of the low-risk virtual environment, the use of multiphase flow modelling and simulation tools will also reduce the cost of physical testing, assist development of new technologies, and the evaluation of novel concepts. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of multiphase flow simulation tools and their recent evolution and adaptation for subsea applications. The focus is on multiphase flow modelling using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation tools, and in particular on their capabilities and limitations when applied to predict the hydrocarbons behavior throughout their journey from the reservoir to the processing facility. Applications of multiphase CFD tools to support the design, operation and monitoring of SPS and the developments and validations required for replacing costly laboratory tests, component qualification and field tests are also addressed and discussed.},

  abstract = {The present work investigates an important and yet unsolved issue: the relationship between the sand flux and the fluid shear stress over a spatially varying bed of particles. It is now recognized that over such a bed, the particle flux is not in equilibrium with the shear stress: there is some lag related to the particle inertia or particle settling. A confident modelling of this relaxation phenomena and the corresponding length scales, is still lacking (Charru, Andreotti and Claudin 2013). This question is investigated here from experiments on barchan dunes in a closed-conduit water flow. From visualizations with a high-speed camera and a tracking algorithm, the particle motion over the whole dune surface is determined: particle trajectories, local velocity and surface density of the moving particles, and local particle flux. The relationship between the local particle flux and local shear stress (estimated from previous analyses) is investigated. Surprisingly, the particle flux appears to be out-ofequilibrium over the whole dune surface, with saturation length much larger than expected.},

  doi = {10.1017/S0022112095000462},
  abstract = {Considerable confusion surrounds the longstanding question of what constitutes a vortex, especially in a turbulent flow. This question, frequently misunderstood as academic, has recently acquired particular significance since coherent structures (CS) in turbulent flows are now commonly regarded as vortices. An objective definition of a vortex should permit the use of vortex dynamics concepts to educe CS, to explain formation and evolutionary dynamics of CS, to explore the role of CS in turbulence phenomena, and to develop viable turbulence models and control strategies for turbulence phenomena. We propose a definition of a vortex in an incompressible flow in terms of the eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor \$$\backslash$bm $\backslash$cal S\^2 + $\backslash$bm Ømega\^2\$; here \$$\backslash$bm $\backslash$cal S\$ and \$$\backslash$bm Ømega\$ are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor \$$\backslash$bm $\backslash$Delta$\backslash$bm u\$. This definition captures the pressure minimum in a plane perpendicular to the vortex axis at high Reynolds numbers, and also accurately defines vortex cores at low Reynolds numbers, unlike a pressure-minimum criterion. We compare our definition with prior schemes/definitions using exact and numerical solutions of the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations for a variety of laminar and turbulent flows. In contrast to definitions based on the positive second invariant of \$$\backslash$bm $\backslash$Delta$\backslash$bm u\$ or the complex eigenvalues of \$$\backslash$bm $\backslash$Delta$\backslash$bm u\$, our definition accurately identifies the vortex core in flows where the vortex geometry is intuitively clear.},

In addition, it is demonstrated that to capture flow dynamics in the high drag reduction (HDR) and MDR regimes, very long computational domain lengths of the order of 104 wall units are required. The simulation results in turn have been used to develop a scaling that describes the interplay between rheological parameters (i.e., maximum chain extension and relaxation time) and the extent of drag reduction as a function of Reynolds number. In addition, turbulence statistics are analyzed and correlations between the polymer body force and velocity fluctuations have been developed with particular emphasis on the HDR and MDR regimes. These observations have been used to decipher the effect of polymer additives on the dynamics of the flow and drag reduction.},

  title = {The Flow Behaviour of Non-{{Newtonian}} Sludges},
  url = {http://gala.gre.ac.uk/6228/},
  abstract = {A large body of data is analysed of the flow of concentrated sewage sludge through straight pipes. Mathematical models are obtained of the laminar and turbulent flow of each main category of sewage sludge. The sludges are modelled as time-independent, non-Newtonian relations between shear stress, rate of shearing strain, and solids concentration. Due to the inhomogeneity of sewage sludge, error analysis becomes pivotal to the data analysis, and options are examined for reducing the error of each model with one or more user-fitted parameters.

Parameter estimation is discussed for viscous, time-independent, non-Newtonian, laminar and turbulent flow models. Due to extensive requirements of the data analysis, the parameter estimation methods are robust, and generally suitable for any shear flow relation. The difficulties of estimating parameters of shear flow models from pipe flow data are addressed.

Numerical algorithms are presented for modelling the flow of time-independent, non-Newtonian, viscous fluids through a straight pipe. Laminar, critical and turbulent flow algorithms are developed to offer predictions such as pressure gradient, mean cross-sectional velocity, and the velocity distribution. To handle the requirements of the data analysis, the algorithms impose few restrictions on the type of shear flow relation, the flow velocity, and the pipe diameter. Suitable pipe flow equations are chosen, and are manipulated mathematically into forms that would yield robust and efficient schemes. The appropriate use of numerical methods for the algorithms is investigated.

Mathematical models of sludge are for use by the sewage industry to give an idea of the flow behaviour of sludges for any relevant application. The parameter estimation techniques and pipe flow algorithms are not constrained to any particular pipe, fluid or flow conditions, so they would be useful for any relevant application.},

  abstract = {Abstract When the hole heaves, falls in or is plagued with excessive fill, much time is lost reaming and redrilling. Typically six to ten days of meshing and reaming are required to remove cavings if the drill string does not get stuck. This paper will be a import of several field applications of methods used to clean a hole. Fluid and well equipment conditions required for proper hole cleaning are given as is the basis for proper hole cleaning are given as is the basis for their selection. Hole cleaning problems and solutions in various hole sizes, different types of rocks and different drilling fluids axe described. Examples are largely from the Delaware, and Anadarko Basins. Very severe hole caving problems have been cured in a short time when the proper conditions are met. Background It has been largely almost since mud was first used in oil well drilling that mud rheology is important to hole cleaning as is annular velocity. An AIME paper entitled "The Use of Mud Laden Water in Drilling Wells" was presented in 1915. It described requirements for and methods of preparing ouch fluids. The author said "As a practical matter, on a drill hole 1500 ft. deep a good mud will not settle in a sufficiently to prevent a drill pipe from being run freely to bottom, and the mud pump from starting circulation, so rotating and drilling can be resumed. That is to say the mud must have properties adequate to clean the hole. properties adequate to clean the hole. Bingham wrote on "Fluidity and Plasticity" in 1922 first describing the non-Newtonian nature of drilling fluids. By the early thirties Marsh, Farnham, Kerr and Ambrose and Loomis had added much. Hence the Marsh funnel. In 1941 Piggott published "Mud Flow in Drilling" which is the basis for all the later hydraulics calculations. In 1950 Williams and Bruce published "Carrying Capacity (of Drilling Mud" and in 1966 Hopkin published "Factors Affecting Cutting Removal Daring published "Factors Affecting Cutting Removal Daring Rotary Drilling. Hopkin showed a correlation between slip velocity and funnel viscosity as well as a similar correlation with yield point. He concluded the yield point gives the more reliable correlation. His data, point gives the more reliable correlation. His data, based on used of an 8.3 to 8.8 ppg mud system, indicates very little improvement in carrying capacity from 0-10 \#/100ft YP. As YP increases from 15 to 35 \#/100ft2 dramatic improvement in carrying capacity occurs. Slip velocity is indicated to decrease to zero at 85 + \#/100ft2. Field results tend to substantiate Hopkins findings. In the; early uses of relaxed filtrate inverted emulsion muds, it was found that even at normal annular velocities (100-150 fpm) when YP was below 8 \#/100ft2 fill was found on trips and occasionally on connections. Since hole cleaning is dependent on hole size those wells provided an excellent test system because of the near perfect gage hole size obtained with that mud. Although, except when a special effort is made to keep YP low, values normally are 10\#/100ft2 or Tore, low solids muds mast have their YP's controlled above the 10\#/100ft2 minimum. The foregoing applies largely, to what is generally considered to be normal sized cuttings. Drillers like to see cuttings measuring 1/4 inch or less in at least one dimension when drilling with mud. then drilling with water, however, much smaller particles axe acceptable. When is air is the drilling particles axe acceptable. When is air is the drilling fluid, cuttings axe no more than a powder. In any case, when the hole enlarges, air and water drilling become impractical. In fact, if the operator persists in attempts to continue the use of either fluid in an enlarged hole, the odds greatly favor the drill pipe becoming stuck. p. 183},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent developments in drilling technology, such as increased sensory information, enhanced data processing and transmitting capacity and capability, and developments in computer controlled machinery, together with adaptation of already available process technology and know-how, are opening up new possibilities for drilling operations. Application of these combined technologies, together with advanced computer modeling, enables enhanced monitoring and increased optimization and control of drilling operations. This paper presents such an integrated system for monitoring and control of the drilling process, currently in the test phase. A key element in the methodology used here is that the models for fluid flow and drilling mechanics are continuously updated in real-time according to the measured data using Kalman filtering techniques. By comparing the calibrated models to real-time data, unwanted occurrences can be detected quickly, and mitigating actions may be taken, either through system control or through manual intervention. Using the calibrated models, safe limits for the drilling operation are computed and enforced, and procedures are optimized. The modules developed cover tripping and reaming, pump start up, friction tests, stick-slip prevention, bit load optimization and monitoring. The methodology may be applied to drilling operations where the drilling equipment is computer controlled.~Surface and preferably downhole data must be available in real time. Rigorous testing with drilling data from offshore drilling operations has been performed, and several full-scale tests have been run on a test rig. The ability to maintain the drilling operation within critical limits has been demonstrated. The methodology may contribute to increased safety and reduced down time during drilling operations. Introduction A large part (25\%, [1]) of the overall cost associated with drilling operations is a result of non-productive time due to unplanned well incidents. The main problems during drilling are related to events such as kick, stuck pipe, wellbore collapse, lost circulation and equipment failures, see [2]. Proper use of real time data has the potential to reduce the down time caused by these events significantly. Availability of real time drilling data is increasing, both from surface instruments and downhole gauges. Open standards for real time data access are being developed. Computer controlled drilling machinery like pumps, draw-work and top drive are available. High band-width communication between the rig sites and the office like fiber optic, high band width VHF and satellite are used. All these combined developments enable enhanced monitoring through data processing, and optimization and control of drilling operations through computer modelling and drilling machinery automation. For many years IRIS has developed advanced computer models for the oil industry. Among these are multiphase well flow models and torque and drag models. Testing and verification is done through studies with comparison to field data. Additional sub models have been incorporated to handle special effects and give the models special features. During the last few years the models have been developed in order to run real time and use available measurements of operational data such as flow rate, inlet temperature, surface torque and hook load. In order to run real time and to be a corner stone in a control system for the drilling operation, the models need to be fast and robust. Drilltronics - A Software System for Monitoring and Control IRIS (former RF-Rogaland Research) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have developed a new drilling, monitoring, control and prediction system called Drilltronics [3]. The main feature of the system is to combine existing hardware and software for monitoring and controlling the drilling process (system environment) with advanced mathematical models for the drilling process. In the implementation of the system we have used existing and upgraded system environment from NOV.},

  abstract = {Abstract Multiphase flows in oil- and gas pipelines involve a variety of different flow regimes. The different flow regimes are determined by the geometric arrangement of oil, gas and water inside the pipe, and evolve in a dynamic manner along a flowline, from bottom hole to receiving facilities. Along the path of the flow, the geometric fluid arrangements (or flow patterns), which develop dynamically, are often outside what is properly accounted for in existing 1D flow models. In such cases, more detailed multidimensional models are needed. As the industry is facing tighter operating margins and stricter regulatory frameworks, more accurate and predictive tools are needed. It is realized that CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) type models cannot replace 1D models in most cases, but will be an extremely valuable addition to the toolbox in cases where the 1D models may be insufficient. In the present paper a CFD method will be presented which enables such generic simulations. In this model, the physics of coexisting large scale interfaces and dispersed fields (droplets and bubbles) has been handled. Results obtained by a "Quasi-3D" implementation of the model will be shown for a number of important industrial applications. It will also be shown how such tools can also be applied to improve existing 1D frameworks, or directly to tackle multiphase production technology challenges.},

Fluids with equal density, viscosity and gel strength according to these criteria still perform differently, especially regarding hole cleaning efficiency. To investigate this discrepancy, two water based fluids, a bentonite and a KCl/polymer based fluid, with identical properties according to API-13I, was studied. A detailed rheological exmination showed that the bentonite fluid has a strong gel-like character and good long-term storage capabilities, while the KCl/polymer fluid has shorter regeneration time following shear stress. We here show how a thorough rheological analyzis can add a valuable supplement to API standard tests.},

  abstract = {A theoretical analysis for turbulent flow of non-Newtonian fluids through smooth round tubes has been performed for the first time and has yielded a completely new concept of the attending relationship between the pressure loss and mean flow rate. In addition, the analysis has permitted the prediction of non-Newtonian turbulent velocity profiles, a topic on which the published literature is entirely silent. To confirm the theoretical analysis, experimental data were taken on both polymeric gels and solid-liquid suspensions under turbulent-flow conditions. Fluid systems with flow-behavior indexes between 0.3 and 1.0 were studied at Reynolds numbers as high as 36,000. All the fully turbulent experimental data supported the validity of the theoretical analysis. The final resistance-law correlation represents a generalization of von Karman’s equation for Newtonian fiuids in turbulent flow and is applicable to all non-Newtonians for which the shear rate depends only on shear stress, irrespective of rheological classification. All the turbulent experimental data for the non-Newtonian systems were correlated by this relationship with a mean deviation of 1.9\%},

  abstract = {Three components of mean velocity and the corresponding Reynolds shear stresses have been measured in fully developed concentric and eccentric annulus flows of a Newtonian fluid at bulk-flow Reynolds numbers of 8900 and 26600 and a weakly elastic shear-thinning polymer at effective bulk-flow Reynolds numbers of 1150, 6200 and 9600. The diameter ratio was 0.5 with eccentricities of 0, 0.5 and 1.0, and the use of a Newtonian fluid of refractive index identical to that of the Perspex working section facilitated the measurements by laser velocimetry.With the Newtonian fluid, the distribution of static pressure measurements on the outer wall is shown to be linear, with friction factors for concentric-annulus flows some 8\% higher than in a smooth round pipe and for the eccentric flows of eccentricities of 0.5 and 1.0 it was lower by, respectively 8 and 22.5\% than that of the concentric-annulus flow. In the former case, the law of the wall was confirmed on both inner and outer walls of the annulus at both Reynolds numbers. This was also the case for the outer wall in the eccentric-annulus flows, except in the smallest gap, but the near-inner-wall flow was not represented by a logarithmic region particularly in the smallest gap. The locations of zero shear stress and zero velocity gradient were displaced by amounts which were, like the secondary flows measured in the eccentric annulus of 0.5, almost within the measurement precision. In the eccentric-annulus flow with eccentricity of 1.0, there was a secondary flow with two circulation cells on each side of the plane of symmetry and with a maximum velocity of 2.2\% of the bulk velocity.The measurements with the non-Newtonian fluid were less detailed since refraction limited the flow accessible to the light beams. The average wall shear stress coefficient was similar to that for the Newtonian fluid in the laminar region of the concentric-annulus flow and higher for the two eccentric-annulus flows. Transition was extended to an effective Reynolds number well above that for the Newtonian fluid with a drag reduction of up to 63\%. The near-outer-wall flows had logarithmic forms between the Newtonian curve and that of the maximum drag-reduction asymptote, and all fluctuation levels were less than those for the Newtonian fluid, particularly the radial and tangential components.},

  abstract = {Mean velocity and the corresponding Reynolds shear stresses of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids have been measured in a fully developed concentric flow with a diameter ratio of 0.5 and at a inner cylinder rotational speed of 300 rpm. With the Newtonian fluid in laminar flow the effects of the inner shaft rotation were a uniform increase in the drag coefficient by about 28 percent, a flatter and less skewed axial mean velocity and a swirl profile with a narrow boundary close to the inner wall with a thickness of about 22 percent of the gap between the pipes. These effects reduced gradually with bulk flow Reynolds number so that, in the turbulent flow region with a Rossby number of 10, the drag coefficient and profiles of axial mean velocity with and without rotation were similar. The intensity of the turbulence quantities was enhanced by rotation particularly close to the inner wall at a Reynolds number of 9,000 and was similar to that of the nonrotating flow at the higher Reynolds number. The effects of the rotation with the 0.2 percent CMC solution were similar to those of the Newtonian fluids but smaller in magnitude since the Rossby number with the CMC solution is considerably higher for a similar Reynolds number. Comparison between the results of the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with rotation at a Reynolds number of 9000 showed similar features to those of nonrotating flows with an extension of non-turbulent flow, a drag reduction of up to 67 percent, and suppression of all fluctuation velocities compared with Newtonian values particularly the cross-flow components. The results also showed that the swirl velocity profiles of both fluids were the same at a similar Rossby number.},

provided very good filtration control. In conclusion, the results confirmed
that PAC could highly improve the bentonite-based mud rheological

of the shear rate and of the magnitude of the complex viscosity as a function of the angular frequency.
After summarizing the relevant definitions and test modes, we show examples of measurements in the linear
viscoelastic range, and applications of the Cox–Merz relationship. Sources of reference fluids with defined
viscosities are presented, and their use in tests for verification of accuracy is demonstrated. Relevant issues,
predominantly for Newtonian reference liquids, are the exploration of measurement limits, related either
to the shear rate range or to reliably accessible viscosity levels. Viscoelastic reference samples are also discussed.
Prerequisites for sample preparation and loading are addressed. In particular, we present recommendations
based on experience from various laboratories. Finally, we discuss the problem of temperature
calibration, presenting techniques that allow the determination of the true sample temperature for a given
set temperature of the rheometer. This paper summarizes contributions from various industrial and academic
laboratories.},

  abstract = {Rheological analysis provides a good comprehension of the
deformation and flow of substances under different stress conditions.
The complex composition of the drilling fluid and the versatile
functions makes rheological studies here indispensable as well as in
other scientific fields like the food industry and material science. In
spite of adding many high-quality additives to the drilling fluids,
problems still occur, such as barite-sag, lost circulation, change of mud
properties (particularly at high and very low temperature), solids
transport. Others are often mentioned as reasons for increasing the cost
of wells. The areas in which rheology plays an important role in
drilling technology will be highlighted in this article. The reason, why
the characterization with the Fann-viscometer alone is not enough for a
detailed view on rheology will be focused on. In addition, measuring
methods which are able to provide detailed information about gel
strength, consistency, gel destruction, gel build up process and yield
point have been investigated. A short overview of the basics of
rheology is given. In this article, novel procedures will be shown on
the basis of flow curve, hysteresis loops, amplitude sweep and 3-
interval-thixotropy-test (3ITT). With these procedures, deeper
knowledge about the drilling fluid system can be obtained.
Implementing these procedures and considering their results in
hydraulic calculation programs or taking them into account by the
design of drilling fluids, can reduce costs and lead to safer drilling
process in general.},

  title = {Rheological Properties of Oil Based Drilling Fluids and Base Oils},
  abstract = {Drilling fluids for oil wells must meet a number of requirements, including maintaining formation integrity, lubricating the drill string, and transporting cuttings to the surface. In order to satisfy these needs, drilling fluids have become increasingly complex and expensive. To ensure safe and efficient drilling, it is vital for the drilling operator to be able to make a qualified choice of fluid appropriate for each individual well.
API/ISO standards specify a set of tests for characterization of drilling fluids. However, fluids that are tested to have equal properties according to these standards are still observed to perform significantly different when used in the field. The aim of the full project is to provide a thorough comparison of drilling fluids in particular with respect to hole cleaning performance, in light of the issues presented above. As part of this investigation we here present results for two oil based drilling fluids, as well as for the corresponding base oil. The drilling fluids differ in composition by varying fraction of base oil, and thus density and water content.
The fluids have been tested according to the API standard, and further, viscoelastic properties have been examined using an Anton Paar rheometer. The rheological test campaign includes determination of the linear viscoelastic range (LVER), viscosity and yield point, thixotropic time test, and temperature dependence of rheological parameters.
Further, it is demonstrated how the rheological data may be used to interpret data from ongoing full scale flow loop experiments with the same fluids. In a more general context, the rheological test campaign of the drilling fluids is expected to make a crucial contribution for the petroleum industry in explaining observed differences in hole cleaning properties beyond what todays API/ISO industry standard provides.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper will describe the technical work performed to develop reliable and reproducible testing procedures for standard purified Polyanionic Cellulose Polymers (PAC) and Drilling Grade Xanthan Gum Polymers (XG) leading to the introduction of new specification in API 13 A/ISO 13500. The absence of standard procedures and specifications for PAC and XG materials have created confusing interpretations of the quality and expected performance. This opened the way to adulteration, primarily with starches (in PAC) and guar gum (in XG). A survey made within the API organization identified the need of standard performance testing procedures and specifications for pure-grade PAC and XG materials as well as adopting a test to easily identify the presence of adulterants. Simple procedures have been developed to identify starch or guar gum presence and establish performance testing procedures. Numerous round-robin tests have been performed to fine-tune the testing procedures and measure intra and inter-labs reproducibility. Only testing procedures providing results with an acceptable standard deviation have been approved. A new set of specifications including the following were finally defined: -~~~~~~ moisture content, fluid loss and viscosity (for PAC) -~~~~~~ moisture content, particle size analysis and viscosity (for XG) The final procedures and specifications for both PAC and XG will be published with the new revision of the API 13 A/ISO 13500 in January 2009.},

  url = {http://www2.dbd.puc-rio.br/pergamum/tesesabertas/0321192_05_pretextual.pdf},
  abstract = {Helical  flow  in  annular  space  occurs  in  drilling  operation  of  oil  and  gas  
wells.  The correct prediction of the flow 
of the drilling mud in the annular space 
between the wellbore wall the the drill pipe is essential to determine the variation 
in  the  mud  pressure  within  the  wellbore,
  the  frictional  pressure  drop  and    the  
efficiency  of  the  transport  of  the  rock  drill  cuttings.    A  complete  analysis  of  this  
situation is extremely complex;  the inner cylinder is usualy rotating, the wellbore 
wall will depart significantly
  from cylindrical, during  
driling  operation  the  drill    
pipe  is  eccentric,  and  the  eccentricity  
varies  with  position  along  the  well.    
Moreover,  drilling  muds  present  pseudoplasti
c  behavior,  the  visc
osity  is  a  strong  
function  of  the  deformation  rate.    A  comp
lete  analysis  of  this  situation  would  
require  the  solution  of  the  three-dimens
ional  momentum  equation  and  would  be  
computationally  expensive  and  complex.    Models  available  in  the  literature  to  
study  this  situation  do  consider  the  rotation  of  the  inner  cylinder  and  the  non  
Newtonian  behavior  of  the  
liquid,  but  assume  the  positi
on  of  the  inner  and  outer  
cilinders  fixed,  i.e.  they  neglect  the  vari
ation  of  the  eccentricity  along  the  length  
of the well, and assume the flow to be 
 well developed.  This approximation leads 
to  a  two-dimensional  model  to  determin
e  the  three  components  of  the  velocity  
field in a cross-section of the annulus.  
 The resulting differential equations have 
to be solved by some numerical method. Th
e model presented in this work takes 
into  account  the  variation  of  the  eccentri
city  along  the  well;  
a  more  appropriate  
description of the geometric 
configuration of directional wells.  As a consequence, 
the  velocity  field  varies  along  the  well  
length  and  the  resulting  flow  model  is  
three-dimensional.  Lubrication theory is
 used to simplify the governing equations into  a  non-linear,  two-dimensional  Poiss
on  Equation  that  describes  the  pressure  
field.  Lubrication  model  was  validated  by  
comparing  the  predictions  to  reported  
results on fully developed flow on eccentric
 annular space.  The results show the 
effect of varying eccentricity, non Newtonian
 behavior and inner cylinder rotation 
on the flow field and on the friction factor.},

  doi = {10.2118/167950-MS},
  abstract = {An experimental study followed by comprehensive flow modeling is presented. The experiments were conducted on a horizontal well setup with drillstring under compression, considering the influence of rotation on frictional pressure losses of Yield Power Law (YPL) fluids. Flow through various buckling configurations with and without drillstring rotation was investigated. A new correlation is presented for the transition from laminar to turbulent regions in concentric and eccentric annuli. A broad model of flow of YPL fluids is proposed for concentric, eccentric and buckled configurations. The model includes the effects of rotation in laminar, transitional and turbulent flow. A 91 ft. inner pipe was rotated while applying axial compression during flow. At the no-compression case, eccentricity of the inner pipe is varied as the drillstring rotated. The aim for such a design was to simulate actual drilling operations. The test matrix involves flow through sinusoidal, transitional and helically-buckled drillstring. The effect of pitch length is investigated. Helical modes with two different pitch lengths were tested. Seven distinct YPL fluids were used to examine the dependence of pressure losses on fluid parameters. In the theoretical part, a stability criterion is modified to determine the onset of transitional flow in YPL fluids and a correlation is proposed for practical purposes. In addition, pressure loss prediction models are presented for the flow of YPL fluids through concentric, eccentric, free and buckled configurations of the drillstring, with and without rotation. The proposed models are compared with the literature and the experiments. It has been observed that increasing eccentricity and rotation causes an earlier transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Increasing eccentricity decreases pressure losses. In addition, the buckled configurations show a further decrease in frictional pressure losses as the compression increases. In the helical mode, decreasing the pitch length results in a decrease in pressure losses. Rotation tests with free drillstring show an increase in pressure losses as the rotary speed of the drillstring increases. Also, rotating the drillstring while it is compressed suggests an elevated increase in pressure losses due to amplified vigorous motion of the drillstring. Distinct differences in the effects of buckling and rotation are observed in laminar, transitional and turbulent flow. The greatest differences are found in the transition region. Flow of YPL fluids is one of the greatest challenges in the modern drilling industry. Studies that correspond to actual drilling conditions are substantially important in reducing these challenges. The information obtained from this study can be used to improve the control of bottomhole pressure during extended reach (ERD), horizontal, managed pressure (MPD), offshore and slim hole drilling applications. Consequently, this theoretical and experimental research has the potential to lead to safer, deeper and more precisely controlled oil/gas well drilling operations.},

  doi = {10.2118/82-01-05},
  abstract = {Abstract There exists a need for an efficient, accurate method for predicting how temperature distributions about the wellbore change with time. This is particularly true in the Arctic, where the proper handling of problems connected with permafrost and gas hydrates can be critically dependent upon such information. Consequently, a computer model has been developed which utllizes a direct solution technique to solve the finite-difference equations describing transient heat transfer in the wellbore. The solution technique used is considerably more efficient than those used in earlier studies. This enables the model to be used at the wellsite, on a real-time basis, to continuously monitor downhole temperatures. The model is sufficiently versatile to allow for the complicated flow histories involved in drilling a well. Parametric sensitivity testing of the model indicates that a number of assumptions underlying previous models are invalid or unnecessary, and that certain previously ignored factors have a significant effect on wellbore temperature profiles.IntroductionThe present trend of drilling deeper and costlier wells requires an increasingly accurate knowledge of the numerous variables involved. One such variable is temperature. In the past, it has been convenient to ignore the temperature distribution in a well and to assume an isothermal system, primarily because no practical means existed for determining the wellbore temperature profile. An accurate means of estimating the temperature distribution, and its variation with time, would have a number of applications, as follows: Cementing program design. Drilling fluid rheology and design. Determination of casing and tubing thermal stresses. Injection and production operations. Well design in permafrost regions. Control of gas hydrates.Temperature data cannot be obtained by physical measurement other than at isolated points, and thus analytical means must be employed to model the system. Such methods have formed the basis of previous work in this area. The literature contains studies ranging from the early simplified graphical methods to the more recent intricate computer models.The earliest study of wellbore temperature is that of Farris(1). He developed charts for predicting bottom-hole circulating temperatures based on measurements made in five shallow Gulf Coast wells. The severe shortcomings of these charts prompted further research into a more precise method of estimating circulating temperatures. Edwardson et al(2) and Tragesser et al(3) developed methods based on an assumed formation temperature distribution after circulation and provided no means of calculating the wellbore temperature distribution directly. Holmes and Swift(4) obtained a steady-state solution to the wellbore heat transfer equations, which cannot be applied to transient behaviour. Raymond(5) developed a method of predicting temperature distributions for both transient and pseudo-steady-state conditions. However, he contended that the pseudo-steady-state solution was adequate for all applications.Most recent research has dealt with means of solving unsteady-state equations formulated by Raymond, or variations on these, using finite-difference techniques(6,7.8.9,l0). Although the earlier methods are simple and easy to apply, they are very inaccurate. The more recent computer models entail solving the finite-difference equations describing the heat transfer by iterative methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract A model describing the two-dimensional transient heat transfer in and around a wellbore is developed. The model considers the fluid flowing down a drill string and returning up the annulus. Calculated results show that the use of steady-state solutions previously published give good estimates of previously published give good estimates of circulating mud temperatures. The transient solution presented here is more suited for matching presented here is more suited for matching temperature logs. The viscous flow energy, rotational energy, and drill bit energy were found to be significant items in the energy balance and are included in the model. Calculated vertical temperature distributions in the innermost casing string permit the determination of the average temperature increase in that pipe. This quantity may then be used to compute thermal stresses and to predict casing stability. Introduction In drilling deep wells (15,000 to 30,000 ft) the geothermal temperatures encountered can cause problems with drilling fluids, drill pipe, and casing. problems with drilling fluids, drill pipe, and casing. To evaluate the effects of these high temperatures on the drill pipe and casing, it is necessary to know the temperature distributions in these pipe strings. Previous work includes the approximate model described by Edwardson et al. for estimating formation temperature disturbances resulting from mud circulation. This work formed the basis for the calculation method that Crawford et al. proposed for estimating mud temperatures. Ramey proposed a model for solution of the wellbore heat transmission problem. He assumed that heat transfer in the problem. He assumed that heat transfer in the wellbore is steady-state while heat transfer in the earth is due to transient radial heat conduction. Ramey's model gave results comparable to the more exact method of Squier et al. and formed the basis for the solution of other wellbore circulation problems. problems. Two recent treatments of the mud circulation problem are based on models that assume steady-state problem are based on models that assume steady-state conditions in both the wellbore and the surrounding earth. The treatment of this problem by Raymond is very good with the exception that he neglected the presence of the casing strings and the effects of presence of the casing strings and the effects of energy sources in the system. The prediction of these temperature distributions can best be accomplished with a two-dimensional thermal model that accounts for the dynamic flow, of mud down the drill pipe and back up through the annulus around the drill pipe, with appropriate heat interchange by convection and conduction. Such a model is described in this paper. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM This problem consists of determining the temperature distribution and around a wellbore during the drilling operations on that well. Drilling fluids are pumped down the drill pipe and recirculated up the annulus surrounding the drill pipe. Energy is added to the fluid columns by the frictional flow losses in the drill pipe and annulus, the shear work done in rotating the drill string, and frictional work at the drill bit. Since the temperature in the earth's crust increases with depth, the drill fluids encounter increasingly higher temperatures with increased depth. This heated fluid then flows to the surface and tends to heat the casing as it passes through it. In deep wells this casing heating can be sufficient to cause excessive thermal stresses and result in pipe buckling. Casing stability predictions can be made if the average temperature increase in the pipe is know. A method for calculating this quantity is presented here. Fig. 1 is a representation of the system considered in this model. We assume that fluid enters the drill string at the surface at a constant rate and known temperature. The fluid flowing down the drill pipe has a vertical temperature distribution resulting from convective heat transfer within the fluid, heat generated by fluid friction, and heat exchange with the drill pipe. A vertical temperature distribution is calculated for the drill pipe by accounting for the vertical conduction of heat in the pipe and the convective heat exchange between the pipe and the fluid columns surrounding it.

  abstract = {Abstract One of the main tasks of drilling fluids is to transport cuttings to the surface to clean the borehole. During this process the fluid is exposed to different flow regimes, shear rates and temperatures. The fluid properties affect the flow behavior, where viscosity, density and gel strength are among the key parameters. Field experience indicates that oil-based drilling fluids perform better in terms of hole cleaning than water-based fluids do, even if viscosity and density values are similar. The exact reasons for this are not entirely understood and increased knowledge will contribute towards more efficient drilling operations. To deepen the understanding of the hole-cleaning abilities of drilling fluids, a comparative study with oil-based and water-based drilling fluids with similar viscosity profiles was executed. Flow-loop experiments in a 10 m long test section with a free-whirling rotating inner drill string are correlated to rheological investigations on a Fann 35 viscometer and an Anton Paar rheometer. The Fann 35 measurements follow the ISO/API standards and include viscosity and gel-strength measurements. With the Anton Paar rheometer flow curves and temperature dependence were obtained. This paper presents selected rheological properties in correlation to flow-loop experiments in order to get a better understanding of the unequal behavior in solids transport of the two drilling fluid types. The presented results include yield point and plastic viscosity determination. In addition Herschel-Bulkley and power-law regressions were used to obtain comparable yield-point values. The rheometer measurements provide more detailed data due to extended functionality of the instrument, higher accuracy for each measuring point and a higher number of data points acquired compared to the Fann viscometer. The yield point of the fluids is expected to influence mainly the static and the low-flow conditions in the wellbore, whereas the plastic viscosity may have more importance in the high-shear region of the flow. To draw back conclusions from the rheology measurements to the flow-loop results, these two points are highlighted in this study.},

  abstract = {AbstractOut Of Straightness (OOS) survey is an investigation procedure aimed to acquire information about the vertical and horizontal configuration of offshore pipelines. The main objective of OSS survey is to provide:• Detailed design and during construction: a quantitative basis for assessment of global - eulerian buckling (upheaval and lateral buckling as results of axial loads due to restrained thermal expansion) in presence of out-of-straightness. This is the case of buried pipelines for which the straightness of the bottom of the trench is a factor.• During operation: verification of the presence of expected or unexpected buckles where bending may exceed the operational limits established for the material and pipe wall thickness, by the mechanical design. This is mainly the case of exposed pipelines for which unexpected lateral deflection can be the result of incidental third party interaction.Global buckling is a significant design topic for HP/HT flowlines or export pipelines in the early stretch, where thermal expansion might be recovered by developing excessive bending. Therefore, the development of specific techniques to perform OOS survey as well as the analysis of the acquired data is getting increasingly crucial, since the outcome of this activity drives the decisions on mitigations needed for pipeline safe operation as per design. After a brief description of the OOS survey technology and engineering interpretative tools, a few operational applications are presented. External survey and in-line inspection outcomes are compared in correspondence of pipeline sections affected by global buckling. The effectiveness of the available technology and engineering tools is discussed.},

  doi = {10.2118/6645-MS},
  abstract = {Abstract Several particle slip velocity correlations have been developed for predicting the carrying capacity of drilling fluids. In this investigation, the published correlations of (1) Preston Moore, (2) published correlations of (1) Preston Moore, (2) Sze-Foo Chien, and (3) Walker and Mayes were evaluated using data obtained in the laboratory under both static and flowing fluid conditions. Data previously published by Sifferman et al. using a previously published by Sifferman et al. using a full-scale vertical annulus also was utilized in this investigation. In addition, a new simplified approach was developed for establishing the carrying capacity of drilling fluids. The procedure involves the use of cutting slip-velocity measurements taken in a static column of fluid. This value for slip velocity is then used to predict cutting transport for flowing conditions. Cutting transport ratio provides an excellent measure of carrying capacity. A convenient linear relationship was found to exist between cutting transport ratio and the reciprocal of annular velocity. When each of the proposed correlations and the new technique were evaluated with respect to the experimental data, the new technique was the only procedure to consistently yield results of acceptable procedure to consistently yield results of acceptable accuracy for the engineering design of drilling operations. Of the three published correlations evaluated, the method proposed by Preston Moore provided the best agreement with the experimental provided the best agreement with the experimental data. Introduction The primary function of drilling fluids in the rotary drilling process is to clean the rock fragments from beneath the bit and transport these cuttings to the surface. Drilling problems related to carrying capacity can result from insufficient as well as excessive annular velocities. When annular velocities are insufficient to effectively transport cuttings to the surface, problems of decreased bit life and slow penetration rates can occur. These problems result penetration rates can occur. These problems result when cuttings are reground several times before they are removed from the bit area. Cutting concentration buildup in the annulus can result in hole fill-up near bottom during trips and even stuck pipe if the cuttings pack off around the drill collars. Lost circulation problems can also occur if the increased cutting concentration produces a sufficient increase in mud density to cause formation fracture. It also must be recognized that excessive annular velocities can cause a reduction in penetration rate. Frictional pressure losses penetration rate. Frictional pressure losses experienced in the drillstring increase as the drilling fluid velocity increases. When the frictional pressure losses in the drillstring are high, the fluid energy available for cleaning at the bit is greatly reduced, again resulting in wasteful regrinding of the rock fragments and poor bottom-hole cleaning. These factors indicate that an optimum annular velocity does exist that is related to the carrying capacity of the drilling fluid in use. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate experimentally the available slip-velocity correlations used for determining the carrying capacity of drilling fluids. The correlations included in this study are those of Preston Moore Sze-Foo Chien, and Walker and Mayes. In addition, a new technique for determining carrying capacity is presented and evaluated. Experimental data used in presented and evaluated. Experimental data used in the evaluation were obtained in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids for both static and flowing conditions. This investigation used data obtained in the laboratory as well as data previously published by Sifferman et al. using a full-scale published by Sifferman et al. using a full-scale vertical annulus. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Williams and Bruce were among the first researchers to recognize the need for establishing a minimum average annular velocity to remove formation cuttings from the borehole. In 1951, they published a classic paper on the carrying capacity of published a classic paper on the carrying capacity of drilling muds.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to review the work already done related to shear rate estimation for non-Newtonian fluids with or without yield point or yield stress with the help of basic integral equation of couette flow. Aqueous solution of drilling fluid additives is non-newtonian in nature and exact shear rate determination helps to predict rheological properties, i.e., apparent, plastic viscosity and yield point very accurately. This estimation helps to select appropriate drilling fluid for optimal penetration rate, which makes drilling economical by reducing rig days required to drill total depth. If the fluid additives are chosen correctly, we protect the well from sloughing shales, drill pipe sticking, fluid loss problem etc. and save time as well. Modern logging tools employ mud pulse telemetry to send data to surface which required suitable drilling fluid for proper data communication. It also affects productivity of well. Rising complexity of fluid has made it pertinent to improve acceptable estimation of shear rate determination of apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity and yield point. This paper examines the generalized difference equation for the coquette flow which is used in the evaluation of m (flow behavior parameter) and k (flow consistency parameter) for power law type fluid and Herschel-bulkley type fluid. The proposed shear rate equations which are considered are quite general and can be applied to any fluid. This review paper confines the equations which have been developed for the determination of shear rate along with the rheological properties for the non-Newtonian fluid with or without yield stress, which is essential for the prediction of suitable drilling fluid properties to achieve successful completion of an oil well.},

The present model is derived to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. Various fluids of practical interest, such as liquid foams, droplet emulsions or blood, present such elastoviscoplastic behavior: at low stress, the material behaves as a viscoelastic solid, whereas at stresses above a yield stress, the material behaves as a fluid. When n = 1 , a recently introduced elastoviscoplastic model proposed by the author is obtained. When 0 \&lt; n \&lt; 1 , then the plasticity criteria becomes smooth, the elongational viscosity is always well defined and the shear viscosity shows a shear thinning behavior. This is a major improvement to the previous elastoviscoplastic model. Finally, when n \&gt; 1 , the material exhibits the unusual shear thickening behavior.},

This new diameter accounts for both annular geometry and the effects of a non-Newtonian fluid. It provides the link between Newtonian pipe flow and non-Newtonian flow through concentric annuli. The method is valid in any flow regime and can be used to determine whether a non-Newtonian flow is laminar, transitional, or turbulent. An analytical procedure is developed for computing frictional pressure gradients in all three flow regimes. The analysis also quantifies how flow transition is delayed by increasing the yield stress of a fluid. In addition, it is shown that transition in an annulus is delayed to higher pump rates as the ratio of inner to outer diameter increases. Furthermore, the method accounts for wall roughness and its affects on transitional and turbulent pressure gradients for non-Newtonian flow through pipes and concentric annuli. Finally, the method runs on a 386 PC in only a few seconds.},

soft glassy materials (colloidal glasses) start flowing abruptly and subsequently accelerate, leading to
avalanches that are remarkably similar to those of granular materials. Rheometrical tests reveal that this
is associated with a bifurcation in rheological behavior: for small stresses, the viscosity increases in time;
the material eventually stops flowing. For slightly larger stresses the viscosity decreases continuously in
time; the flow accelerates. Thus the viscosity jumps discontinuously to infinity at the critical stress. We
propose a simple physical model capable of reproducing these effects.},

  abstract = {Three velocity components of a Newtonian and a weakly elastic shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluid have been measured in an annulus with an eccentricity of 0.5, a diameter ratio of 0.5, and an inner cylinder rotation of 300 rpm. The results show that the rotation had similar effects on the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, with a more uniform axial flow across the annulus and the maximum tangential velocities in the narrowest gap in both cases. The secondary flow circulation with the Newtonian fluid at a Reynolds number of 26,600 was in the direction of the rotation, with maximum values of 14\% of the bulk velocity close to the inner pipe. With the 0.2\% CMC polymer solution in laminar flow, rotation caused a narrow counter-rotating flow along the outer pipe wall, which was absent at a Reynolds number 9200. The turbulence intensities in the region of widest gap were uninfluenced by rotation, increased in the Newtonian fluid, and decreased in the non-Newtonian fluid in the region of the smallest gap. The flow resistance of both fluids increased with rotation at low Reynolds numbers and reduced with increasing values to become similar to those of nonrotating flows. Comparison between rotating results of the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids at a Reynolds number 9200 and the same inner cylinder rotation, showed effects similar to those of nonrotating flow with extension of nonturbulent flow, large reduction in turbulence intensities and drag reduction of the order of 61\% for the CMC solution. The swirl velocities in both fluids were similar when the Rossby numbers were similar.},

  abstract = {AbstractFlow through annulus is frequent in drilling and work-over operations. Annular flow is also utilized in some fracturing treatments. In all these applications, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are widely used. Therefore the knowledge of annular flow performance of these fluids becomes important for planning and design of well-bore hydraulics. Existing knowledge about the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids in annulus is very limited due to their complex behaviour. A range of correlations is available in the literature for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in laminar and turbulent flow regime. Selection of the appropriate correlation for the desired fluid and flow regime is very important for the accurate determination of friction losses. Experimental and simulation study has been undertaken to investigate the flow behavior and friction pressure losses of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in concentric annuli. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been used along with limited experimentation on a field-scale set up to validate the simulation results. The fluids investigated are water and frequently used concentrations of guar and Xanthan fluids. CFD simulations have been performed for different annular dimensions in flow range encompassing both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The annular dimensions used in the simulations cover the range used in the industry. The frictional losses of non-Newtonian fluids exhibiting drag-reducing characteristics have been investigated through experiments.Based on the comparison with simulation results recom¬mendations are made to use the appropriate correlations for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in the laminar and turbulent flow regime.Improved correlations are proposed to determine frictional losses of non-Newtonian fluids exhibiting drag-reducing characteristics. These correlations are based on experimental data gathered for a wide range of concentrations of guar and Xanthan fluids. The recommendations made along with the correlations presented in this study will greatly improve the accuracy of determining friction pressure losses in concentric annuli.IntroductionFlow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids through annulus has received considerable attention in the past. The flow of Newtonian fluids in annulus has been studied extensively in fluid mechanics literature. On the other hand, knowledge of annular flow of non-Newtonian fluids is limited due to the complex nature of these fluids.Understanding annular flow of fluids with different rheological properties is important, as accurate knowledge of flow performance of different fluids is critical in the planning and design of the hydraulics program of a well. Significant pressure losses can occur in the constrained space, which necessitates their accurate estimation. The knowledge of rheological data and methods of predicting pressure losses are the key points to calculate proper pump rates and avoid any obstacle in the normal operation of oil production. Determination of friction pressures is useful in calculating horsepower requirements, bottomhole treating pressure, and maximum wellhead pressure. Accurate knowledge of friction losses is also important from economic point of view. Optimizing the friction pressure loss calculations through the well bore annulus allows making an appropriate evaluation of the well-bore hydraulics, which is essential to reduce the problems and avoid high costs of operation.},

  abstract = {Summary The annular frictional performance of non-Newtonian fluids is among the major considerations during development of hydraulic programs for drilling operations. Proper estimation of the frictional pressure losses become more critical when determining hydraulic horsepower requirements and selecting proper mud pump systems to foresee any serious problems that might occur with hydraulics during drilling operations. Because the rheological behaviour of the non-Newtonian fluids is known to be challenging, it becomes even more complicated during pipe rotation, especially in eccentric wellbores. In many cases, significant differences are observed when theoretical calculations and measurements for pressure losses are compared. This study aims to develop correction factors for determining the frictional pressure losses accurately in eccentric horizontal annulus for non-Newtonian fluid, including the effect of pipe rotation. Extensive experimental work has been conducted on METU-PETE Flow Loop for numerous non-Newtonian drilling fluids, including KCl-polymer muds and PAC systems for different flow rates and pipe rotation speeds, and frictional pressure losses are recorded during each test. Rheological characteristics of the drilling fluids are determined using a rotational viscometer. Observations showed that pipe rotation has a significant influence on frictional pressure loss, especially at lower flow rates. Up to a point, as the pipe rotation increases, the frictional pressure losses also increase. As the flow rates are increased, the effect of pipe rotation on frictional pressure losses diminishes. Also, after a certain pipe rotation speed, no additional contribution of pipe rotation on frictional pressure loss is observed. When the developed friction factors are used, there is a good agreement between the calculated and observed frictional pressure losses for any pipe rotation speed.},

  abstract = {Keeping control of the downhole pressure is important in any drilling situation, and especially
when a narrow pressure window is experienced. The equivalent circulation density is
influenced by rotation of the drillpipe, but there is no existing mathematical description for
this behavior.
In present project, existing knowledge of how drillpipe rotation affects pressure losses was
presented, and used as a foundation in the development of empirical equations through
regression analysis. Several data sets were gathered from various field studies, and a set of
working equations was developed. The equations were presented in two different forms. One
equation expressed pressure losses with rotation and without rotation, ΔPω≠0/ΔPω=0 vs.
revolutions per minute. The three other equations describes ΔPω≠0/ΔPω=0 vs. Reynolds
number, for selected rotation speeds.
The four equations were tested for their accuracy by comparing with simulations performed in
the software Drillbench®, by comparing with an existing mathematical model, and by
comparing with virgin field data. All equations gave predictions close to the existing semiempirical
model. The equation described as a function of RPM predicted a smaller pressure
loss ratio than the field study for a rotation speed of 60 RPM, but came within the results from
this study for a rotation speed of 120 RPM. The equations expressed as a function of
Reynolds number gave results closer to the semi-empirical model than the RPM-equation. All
equations predicted a larger pressure loss than the simulations performed in Drillbench®, in
some cases even twice as large.
To further improve the equations, larger data sets have to be acquired. The quality of the
equations will improve if they cover more situations, and if they are based on a wider spread
in the data sets.},

  title = {Turbulence Modeling Using {{RANS}} Models with a Pre-Defined Filter Size},
  abstract = {This report is summarizing work done during the sabbatical of S.T. Johansen (2002-2003), at the
University of Florida, Gainsville. Wei Shyy acted as host and contributed to the work. Later some more
simulations were done (2004-2005), and finally (2016) the report can be finalized.
The objective of the work was to come up with a hybrid model which on fine grids become a LES or
DNS model, while on coarse grids may collapse into a RANS turbulence model. In this case the actual
RANS models is the standard k - \& model. However, the methods developed here may be applied to
any RANS model, including Reynolds stress models.
The model was named "Filtered URANS (Unsteady Reynolds Averages Navier Stokes) model". The
filter size is considered as independent of the grid size. If the filter is made depending on a grid which
varies through space, additional source terms appear; here, in the non-resolved turbulent kinetic energy.
The Filtered URANS model is found to perform significantly better than the k - \& model on vortex
shedding on cylinders. In this report we further show that 2D simulations of flows in cyclones can be
closely reproduced by this model. The model must be run transient in order to capture the physics.
Recentlv. our model has been referred to as VVLES (Verv Verv LaruP. Eddv Simulation).},

  abstract = {Traditional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches to turbulence modelling, such as the k-ϵ model, has some well-known shortcomings when modelling transient flow phenomena. To mitigate this, a filtered URANS model has been derived where turbulent structures larger than a given filter size (typically grid size) is captured by the flow equations and smaller structures are modelled according to a modified k-ϵ model. This modelling approach is also known as a VLES model (Very Large Eddy Scale model), and provides more details of the transient turbulence than the k-ϵ model at little extra computational cost.
In this study a two-phase extension to the VLES model is described. A modelling concept for bubble plumes has been developed in which the bubbles are tracked as particles and the flow of liquid is solved by the Navier-Stokes equations in a traditional mesh based approach. The flow of bubbles and liquid is coupled in an Eulerian-Lagrangian model. Turbulent dispersion of the bubbles is treated by a random walk model. The random walk model depends on an estimation of the eddy life time. The eddy life time for the VLES model differs from a k-ϵ model, and its mathematical expression is derived.
The model is applied to ocean plumes emanating from discharge of gas at the ocean floor. Validation with experiments and comparison with k-ϵ model are shown.},

  abstract = {In oil and gas drilling, cuttings transport related problems are a major contributor to well downtime and costs. As a result, solutions to these problems have been extensively researched over the years, both experimentally and through simulation. Numerous review articles exist, summarizing not only the research history but also the qualitative effect of individual case parameters such as e.g. pump flow rate, pipe rotation, rate of penetration on cuttings transport. However, comparing different studies is challenging, as there is no common reference basis defined in the form of typical and representative set of case parameters. In order to develop relevant and accurate cutting transport models, it is critical that both experiments and models are targeting flow cases, which are relevant for respective drilling operations. By developing a clear understanding of the industrial parameter space, as well as establishing critical benchmarks, the development of models and corresponding laboratory experiments will become much easier. Other industries have established such benchmarks (e.g. the "NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine" in wind power research), providing a standardized set of case parameters and profiles, readily available for use to researchers worldwide and resulting in straightforward benchmark and validation as well as faster project set-up and definition. For application to modeling of cuttings transport phenomena, we propose a methodology how to derive a well-defined and standardized set of geometrical, operational, and environmental case parameters describing various working points of actual drilling operations and procedures as well as simplified problems. The relevance and application of standard parameters is briefly discussed in the light of modeling, both experimentally and through simulations.},

Hole-cleaning is a very complex subject, which integrates fluid mechanics, fluid rheology, thermodynamics and mechanics. Since the introduction of hole-cleaning research several works have been carried out to investigate the behavior of cutting transport through modeling and experimental studies. In this thesis, the sensitivity of several parameters associated with the hole-cleaning was studied. For the analysis, widely known industry standard software, WellPlanTM /Landmark, was used. The results are in line with experimental works documented in literatures. The overall simulation analyses are summarized. In addition, list of recommendations as future work are proposed.},

  abstract = {The calcuatiDn of single phase and two phase flowing
pressure gradients in a well annulus is generally
based on an extension of empirical correlations developed
for Newtonian fluids in circular pipes. Various
techniques for extending pipe flow correlations to an
annular geometry have been presented in the literature
which involve the representation of the annular well
geometry with an equivalent circular diameter and the
representation of non-Newtonian fluid behavior with
an apparent Newtonian viscosity. Unfortunately, little
experimental data have been available which would allow
a comparison of the relative accuracy of the various
proposed techniques.
In this study, experimental pressure gradient data
have been taken in two 6000 ft. wells\_ Frictional
pressure losses for single phase flow (mud only) in two
annuli were compared to values predicted by the Bingham
Plastic and Power law Models. These calculations utilized
the equivalent diameters defined by the Crittendon
criteria, the hydraulic radius, and the slot approximation.
Also, total pressure difference for two-phase
flow was measured for one annular geometry. This data
was compared to that predicted by the Poettmann and
Carpenter, Hagedorn and Brown, Orkiszewski, and Beggs
and Brill correlations.
Comparison of experimental data with the various
prediction techniques was favorable, each having advantage
in certain situations. For the data investigated,
the Crittendon criteria using a Bingham Plastic
Model gave the best results. The two phase flow data
was best predicted by the Hagedorn and Brown correlation
utilizing a hydraulic radius equivalent diameter.},

Results for a power law (shear-thinning) rheology agree well with experimentally determined logarithmic layer correlations and with other previously published experimental work. As the flow index becomes smaller for the same Reynolds number, the flowdeviates further from the Newtonian profile and the results suggest that transition is delayed. Predicted friction factors fall above those in the literature, but below the Newtonian values when a comparison is undertaken on the basis of the Metzner–Reed Reynolds number. Results for a Herschel–Bulkley model (yield stress + shear-thinning) are compared to corresponding experimental measurements and are found to be in very good agreement.

  abstract = {A spectral element—Fourier method (SEM) for Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the turbulent flow of non-New- tonian fluids is described and the particular requirements for non-Newtonian rheology are discussed. The method is imple- mented in parallel using the MPI message passing kernel, and execution times scale somewhat less than linearly with the number of CPUs, however this is more than compensated by the improved simulation turn around times. The method is applied to the case of turbulent pipe flow, where simulation results for a shear-thinning (power law) fluid are compared to those of a yield stress (Herschel–Bulkley) fluid at the same generalised Reynolds number. It is seen that the yield stress significantly dampens turbulence intensities in the core of the flow where the quasi-laminar flow region there co-exists with a transitional wall zone. An additional simulation of the flow of blood in a channel is undertaken using a Carreau–Yasuda rheology model, and results compared to those of the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier– Stokes) model. Agreement between the mean flow velocity profile predictions is seen to be good. Use of a DNS technique to study turbulence in non-Newtonian fluids shows great promise in understanding transition and turbulence in shear thinning, non-Newtonian flows.},

  abstract = {Concepts for "pragmatism in industrial modeling", were presented and discussed at CFD2014 in Trondheim, Norway (Zoric, et al., 2014). A framework (FW) for pragmatic industrial modeling was suggested and demonstrated on industrial use cases by a process centric approach. In the present paper, these concepts will be extended through a data and information centric perspective (Analysis and use of data and metadata, their organization, syntax and semantics), exemplified by a new use case, related to drilling of oil \& gas wells. The analytical problem is to produce a model which can predict the motion of a spherical particle embedded in laminar non-Newtonian flow. An overview of tasks, procedures, organization and flow of data, required metadata, and technical and quality requirements is given. In particular we clarify input and output from various modeling and experimental phases, as well as the flow of data and metadata in the modeling process. In addition we analyze the structure and organization of input data for the modeling and experimental work, such as rheometer data from the lab. The uncertainty in the characterization of the fluid will impact the accuracy of the model predictions. We next make example simulations to illustrate the steps in the solution process, and related flow of the necessary metadata and raw data. The necessary uncertainty assessments and the corresponding metadata needed to support the entire modeling process are also discussed. Quantification of uncertainty will be demonstrated using polynomial chaos to assess the effect of uncertainties in the parameters for the non-Newtonian viscosity model. Finally, we summarize the findings and discuss how the "pragmatism in industrial modeling" concept can help building more consistent industrial models, answering to customer needs for actual accuracy and delivery speed.},

The equilibrium rheological structure of this thixotropic liquid is well characterised by the Herschel-Bulkley model. Velocity profiles calculated for a Herschel-Bulkley fluid prove to be a very accurate representation of the measurements for laminar flow at reynolds numbers below about 1500. The measured profiles develop an unexplained asymmetry for higher Reynolds numbers until the flow undergoes transition to turbulence. The fluid is drag reducing under turbulent flow conditions with relative levels of tangential and radial turbulence intensity suppressed in comparison with water whilst the axial turbulence intensity is little different. Under all flow conditions it is evident that the fluid rheology is far from structural equilibrium, with values for the apparent yield stress and effective viscosity determined from near-wall velocity measurements considerably below those obtained from a rheometer.},

A traditional Shields plot constructed from data that represent initial motion of the bed surface material reveals systematic methodological biases of incipient motion definition;
. values determined from reference bed load transport rates and from visual observation of grain motion define subparallel Shields curves, with the latter generally underlying the former; values derived from competence functions define a separate but poorly developed field, while theoretical values predict a wide range of generally higher stresses that likely represent instantaneous, rather than time-averaged, critical shear stresses. The available data indicate that for high critical boundary Reynolds numbers and low relative roughnesses typical of gravel-bedded rivers, reference-based and visually based studies have
ranges of 0.052–0.086 and 0.030–0.073, respectively. The apparent lack of a universal

  abstract = {The Bagnold hypothesis has been a major tool in the development of mechanistic models of bed load transport. According to the hypothesis, a necessary constraint for the maintenance of equilibrium bed load transport is that the fluid shear stress at the bed must be reduced to the critical, or threshold value associated with incipient motion of grains. The constraint determines a functional form for the areal concentration of bed load grains as a function of flow parameters. It is shown here, however, that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bed load transport on beds with transverse slopes above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. In particular, under such conditions it is shown that no areal concentration, no matter how large, is sufficient to reduce the fluid shear stress at the bed to the critical value. This failure motivates the abandonment of the Bagnold constraint, even for nearly horizontal beds. The framework presented here, however, provides a natural basis for an entrainment-based model of sediment transport that neither satisfies nor suffers from the drawbacks of the Bagnold constraint.},

  abstract = {Attention is given to the properties of sediment beds over the full range of conditions (silts to gravel), in particular the effect of fine silt on the bed composition and on initiation of motion (critical conditions) is discussed. High-quality bed-load transport data sets are identified and analyzed, showing that the bed-load transport in the sand range is related to velocity to power 2.5. The bed-load transport is not much affected by particle size. The prediction of bed roughness is addressed and the prediction of bed-load transport in steady river flow is extended to coastal flow applying an intrawave approach. Simplified bed-load transport formulas are presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of bed-load transport in river and coastal flows. It is shown that the sediment transport of fine silts to coarse sand can be described in a unified model framework using fairly simple expressions. The proposed model is fully predictive in the sense that only the basic hydrodynamic parameters (depth, current velocity, wave height, wave period, etc.) and the basic sediment characteristics ( d10 , d50 , d90 , water temperature, and salinity) need to be known. The prediction of the effective bed roughness is an integral part of the model.},

The most-important parameters for hole cleaning are divided into several ranges on the basis of their sensitivity to cuttings concentration in the wellbore. A series of charts is obtained by running a hole-cleaning simulator, which is based on a large number of experimental and modeling studies of cuttings transport. The difference between the charts’ prediction results and experimental data is within 20\%. Drilling engineers can quickly estimate the cuttings volumetric concentration by looking up the charts and conducting very-simple calculations.},

  abstract = {Particle settling is relevant for several aspects of drilling and completion operations, and is directly related to safety and operational eciency. The primary function of particles added to drilling uids is to provide density stabilizing the wellbore and hinder in ux of uids and gas, causing a kick situation. Keeping the particles suspended in the uids is also critical to avoid problems such as stuck down hole equipment, poor cementing of casings, lost circulation and avoid formation damage. The main objective of the present work is to improve the understanding of particle settling in non-Newtonian drilling uids. The work focuses on identifying parameters critical for particle settling which are directly relevant for everyday handling and use of drilling and completion uids. To identify these parameters, laboratory techniques have been developed that allow continuous monitoring of the particle settling process in a uid. The majority of the parameters identi ed have previously not been studied by the oil industry. This includes parameters such as the composition of the internal brine phase of oil based drilling uids, added shear energy during preparation of these and the e ect of particle morphology on settling. Operational parameters, such as vibrations during drilling, and the eciency of solids removal equipment have also been discovered to have signi cant impact on the particle settling rate. Throughout this work the complexity of particle settling in the uids has clearly been demonstrated. Conventional settling models have shown not to predict the e ect of this phenomena accurately. The complexity of the sag phenomena requires the development of signi cantly improved practical equipment to optimize and monitor the sag stability of drilling uids at the rig site.},

  abstract = {Efficient cuttings transport and hole cleaning is very important for obtaining an effective drilling operation. In inclined and horizontal drilling, hole cleaning issues is a common and complex problem. This thesis explores the impact of various drilling parameters, and how they affect the required flow velocity and flow rate required for effective cuttings transport. The main objectives of the thesis are outlined as follows:  To make a sufficient review of previous studies;  Explain the fundamentals of the cuttings transport parameters and definitions;  To introduce and explain in great details the empirical model focusing on the models of Larsen and Rubiandini;  To make an introduction to the mechanistic modeling approach focusing on demonstrating the complexity of these models;  To apply Larsen‟s and Rubiandini‟s models in order to compare and identify similarities and differences between the models;  To present some field experience from offshore;  To draw conclusions about what we can learn from earlier studies and research. The thesis employs two models developed by an empirical approach, namely Larsen‟s model and Rubiandini‟s model. Two simulation scenarios have been considered. First, we have compared the models using the cases defined by Larsen from his experimental work. Then, an example well has been considered which mimics more operational conditions. Moreover, the thesis presents the mechanistic two-layer model developed by Kamp and Rivero, and demonstrates how the model has to be reformulated mathematically before a numerical method can be used for solving the model. The analysis of the two empirical models showed that both models show the same trend for required cuttings transport flow velocity and flow rate when drilling parameters, such as mud weight, ROP, mud rheology and drill-pipe diameter varied. For the horizontal case, we observe that Larsen predicts flow rate that are not far from the flow rates typical seen in operations, however it slightly over predicts required cuttings transport velocity. Rubiandini‟s model seems to predict high flow rate required for cuttings transport. However, for the vertical case, the predicted rate seems to coincide with flow rates typical in operations. The main advantage of Rubiandini‟s model is that in his work, he considered RPM as a variable that could affect the cuttings transport. The results also indicate that Larsen‟s model and Rubiandini‟s model show the opposite effect on required cuttings transport velocity when the cuttings size is a variable parameter. In the Larsen‟s model, smaller cuttings required higher flow velocity to be transported, while inthe Rubiandini‟s model, the opposite is observed, namely larger cuttings need a higher flow velocity for transport in the wellbore. In the conclusion, several recommendations on how to achieve better cuttings transport and hole cleaning are listed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new theory of turbulence in time-independent non-Newtonian fluids. The wall layer is modelled in terms of unsteady exchange of viscous momentum between the wall and the main stream, following the classic visualisation of inrush-sweep-ejection/burst. The thickness of the wall layer is found to be the same for Newtonian and purely viscous non-Newtonian fluids, when normalised with the instantaneous wall parameters at the onset of bursting. The results indicate that the mechanisms of turbulence in Newtonian and time-independent fluids are identical when structural similarity relations in turbulence are based on phase-locked parameters linked with the development of secondary flows rather than on time-averaged wall parameters. This similarity analysis collapses the local critical instantaneous friction factor data of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids at the point of bursting into a single curve. The method greatly simplifies the analysis of turbulent transport phenomena in non-Newtonian fluids. Keywords: Turbulence, time-independent non-Newtonian, Power law, pipe flow, wall layer},

  title = {Improvements of Cuttings Transport Models through Physical Experiments and Numerical Investigations of Solid-Liquid Transport},
  url = {http://d-nb.info/1101965851/34},
  abstract = {Wellbore drilling has experienced an increase in complexity due to the interest in reaching
targets situated in High Pressure-High Temperature (HPHT) environments or constructing
large sections of the well with high deviations from verticality. Established models
for selecting operational flow rates or drilling fluid rheology and density are based on
empirical correlations. These are only applicable for well defined ranges of conditions and
for stationary assumptions not given in complex wellbores. In the last two decades, more
flexible and transient models founded on causal mechanisms responsible of the system’s
behavior are finding wider application. These rely on an accurate understanding of the
phenomena taking place within the wellbore. High resolution numerical models can be
used to increase this understanding. However, experimental data are still needed for their
validation. This thesis provides such experimental data and evaluates high resolution
numerical models able to predict cuttings transport relevant phenomena at the wellbore
diameter scale.
In the experimental part of this thesis, a solid-liquid vertical flow-loop designed and constructed
to generate experimental data for validation is presented. The setup consists of a
64 mm diameter and 2,000 mm length pipe, medicinal white oil and glass spherical particles
with diameters ranging from 2 to 6 mm providing a system with physical phenomena
similar to the one found in cuttings transport. The particle image velocimetry (PIV)
and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) techniques are implemented to obtain liquid and
particles velocity profiles as well as particle position histograms of solid-liquid mono- and
bidisperse flows. This is accomplished through refractive index matching of the dispersed
phase, the continuous phase and the conduct material. Results point out the relevancy of
the lift force in configuring particles distribution across the pipe section. This force creates
concentration accumulations at specific radial positions. Furthermore, a significant
momentum transfer between the considered particles is observed in bidisperse systems.
The computational part of the thesis considers the implementation of the two-fluid method
and the discrete particle model (DPM) to simulate the experimental system and prove
their validity for the prediction of cuttings transport relevant problems. The two-fluid
method shows good agreement with experiments performed with monodisperse systems
and supplies an explanation for the concentration accumulations observed in the experiments.
However, this lacks predictive capacity when polydisperse systems are investigated.
On the other hand, the DPM model implemented here is able to reproduce bidisperse experimental
results up to 3\% concentrations. For higher ones, advanced models considering
particle collisions in viscous fluids should be included. The DPM model is selected as the best alternative for cuttings transport problems. A sensitivity analysis focused on the
effect of eccentricity on vertical particle transport is finally conducted to demonstrate
which information can be extracted. The sensitivity analysis reveals the effect of the lift
force on particle transport, which results in better transport than the one predicted with
the homogeneous particle distribution assumption, normally taken in drilling engineering
calculations.},

  abstract = {The problem of suspended sediment transport in river and coastal flows is addressed. High-quality field data of river and coastal flows have been selected and clustered into four particle size classes (60–100, 100–200, 200–400, and 400–600 μm ). The suspended sand transport is found to be strongly dependent on particle size and on current velocity. The suspended sand transport in the coastal zone is found to be strongly dependent on the relative wave height ( Hs ∕h) , particularly for current velocities in the range 0.2–0.5 m∕s . The time-averaged (over the wave period) advection–diffusion equation is applied to compute the time-averaged sand concentration profile for combined current and wave conditions. Flocculation, hindered settling, and stratification effects are included by fairly simple expressions. The bed-shear stress is based on a new bed roughness predictor. The reference concentration function has been recalibrated using laboratory and field data for combined steady and oscillatory flow. The computed transport rates show reasonably good agreement (within a factor of 2) with measured values for velocities in the range of 0.6–1.8 m∕s and sediments in the range of 60–600 μm . The proposed method underpredicts in the low-velocity range ($<$0.6 m∕s) . A new simplified transport formula is presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of suspended transport. The modeling of wash load transport in river flow based on the energy concept of Bagnold shows that an extremely large amount of very fine sediment (clay and very fine silt) can be transported by the flow.},

  abstract = {Abstract
The evolution and migration of large dunes in a realistic intermediate-size experimental stream, the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) Outdoor StreamLab (OSL), and two large-scale meandering rivers with in–stream rock structures are studied numerically using the SAFL Virtual StreamLab hydro-morphodynamic (VSL3D) model. Due to the challenges arising from mesh quality and large disparity in time-scales, coupled morpho- and hydro-dynamics simulations of bed forms has, for the most part, been restricted to sand wave amplitudes of few centimeters. In this work, we overcome such difficulties by employing the immersed boundary approach and a dual time–stepping technique of the VSL3D model [63]. The VSL3D employs the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method along with a suspended sediment load module and is capable of simulating turbulent stratified flows coupled with bed morphodynamic evolution in realistic riverine environments with arbitrarily complex hydraulic structures. Turbulence is handled either via large-eddy simulation (LES) with the dynamic Smagorinski subgrid scale model or unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations closed with the k - ω turbulence model. Simulations in the intermediate-scale OSL channel, in which we also collected experimental morphodynamic data, show that LES can capture the evolution and migration of bed forms with characteristics that are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The URANS model, however, fails to excite the bed instability in the OSL channel but captures realistic dune evolution in the two large-scale meandering rivers. This finding is especially important as it demonstrates the potential of the VSL3D model as a powerful tool for simulating morphodynamic evolution under prototype conditions. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to simulate large-scale bed forms in waterways with an order of magnitude disparity in spatial scales, from the ∼2.7 m wide OSL channel to the 27 m wide rivers. Accordingly, the height of the simulated dunes ranges from ∼0.2 m to 2.0 m and the wavelength ranges from ∼0.1 m to 50 m for the OSL and large-scale rivers, respectively. For all cases the statistical properties of the simulated bed forms are shown to agree well with those of bed forms observed in nature.},

  isbn = {978-1-61399-208-1},
  doi = {10.2118/151176-MS},
  abstract = {Abstract Annular flow of non-Newtonian fluids remains a ubiquitous phenomenon in drilling operations but accurately estimating the frictional pressure loss with drill pipe rotation still poses a great challenge. Since annular frictional pressure losses increases the equivalent circulating density (ECD), it becomes imperative to accurately estimate the annular pressure loss in order to keep the ECD above the pore pressure and below the fracture gradient especially in deep offshore drilling where the pore pressure and fracture pressure are so close together. When annular flows are encountered, a common practice is to calculate an effective diameter such that the flow behavior in a circular pipe would be roughly equivalent to the flow behavior in the annulus. This equivalent diameter definition replaces the diameter term in the friction factor, effective Reynolds number and Taylors number equations used for pipe flow thus resulting in different frictional pressure loss estimation. As a result, the selection of appropriate correlation for the respective fluids, flow regimes and putting into consideration pipe rotation has become important but has received very little attention. In this study, the seven different equivalent diameter definitions used for estimating frictional pressure losses in an annulus were reviewed and theoretical analysis were performed on experimental data obtained from literatures to determine the effect of these definitions on wellbore hydraulics. Pressure loss ratios (PLR) which relates pressure loss with pipe rotation to pressure loss without pipe rotation weredevelopedfor each equivalent diameter definitionusing dimensional analysis techniques. These hydraulic models combined with conventional frictional pressure loss estimation were tested with experimental measurements to determine the model with an equivalent diameter definition that best predicts frictional pressure losses for power law fluids. Introduction One of the major considerations in the development of hydraulic programs for drilling and work-over operations is properly estimating the annular pressure losses of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Since the objective of any drilling operation is to minimize drilling cost and maximize return on investment, optimizing annular friction pressure loss estimation allows making an appropriate evaluation of the well-bore hydraulics necessary for drilling in order to avoid serious problems which can cause interruption in the drilling operations thus resulting to high costs of operation, increase in non-productive time and sometimes lead to well abandonment. Hence, it is very critical to determine annular pressure losses with high accuracy. Pressure loss estimation in annulus is more difficult to model compared to pipe flow since the geometry of the area open to flow is more complex and as a result, different effective diameter definitions have been proposed in the literatures for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. However, for simplicity and convenience, two equations are generally used. The first equation is based upon the definition of the hydraulic diameter, dH, is defined as four times the channel cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter of the flow channel. For an annulus of inner diameter di and outer diameter do, d\_H=d\_o-d\_i. For turbulent flow in ducts running full, the hydraulic diameter, dH, should be substituted for D in the friction factor and Reynolds number definitions. Turbulent flow in noncircular channels is generally accompanied by secondary flows perpendicular to the axial flow direction. These flows may cause the pressure drop to be slightly greater than that computed using the hydraulic diameter method. The hydraulic diameter method does not work well for laminar flow because the shape affects the flow resistance in a way that cannot be expressed as a function only of the ratio of cross-sectional area to wetted perimeter (Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook).},

  doi = {10.2118/111514-PA},
  abstract = {Summary The flow of non-Newtonian fluids through eccentric annuli is prevalent during drilling and cementing operations of directional and horizontal wells. The flow pattern in an eccentric annulus can differ greatly from that in a concentric annulus, and this difference affects both the pressure drop and the flow rate at which the laminar-turbulent transition occurs. Errors resulting from ignoring the effect of eccentricity on frictional pressure drop and equivalent circulating density can lead to formation fracture or well-control problems in some situations. In this paper, a new method is presented for calculating pressure losses in eccentric annuli. The method is based on an effective diameter that accounts for the effects of both conduit geometry and fluid rheology. Predictions of the method are compared with an extensive set of data for drilling fluids obtained from a large-scale flow loop. The results demonstrate that the new method is capable of reliably predicting the pressure drop of most drilling fluids in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes for eccentric annular geometries of practical interest. Introduction The flow of non-Newtonian fluids through eccentric annuli occurs during drilling and cementing operations for oil and gas wells. Approximate and exact (numerical) solutions to the fundamental flow equations in this geometry have been published for Bingham plastic, power-law, and yield-power-law fluids. The purpose of this article is to present a generalized method for computing frictional pressure losses in eccentric annuli that is applicable to a wide variety of drilling fluids. Predictions obtained with the new method are compared with experimental data from a large flow loop that are available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Summary The challenge of theoretical and numerical studies of annular fluid flow with varying eccentricity is mainly a result of the required coordinate systems. Computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) modeling provides the state-of-the-art approach of investigating fluid flow in such complex geometries. In this study, results from a series of numerical simulations for the fully developed laminar flow of non-Newtonian power-law fluids in concentric and eccentric annular geometries are used to investigate the effect of eccentricity, flow-behavior index, and diameter ratio (ratio of the outer diameter of the inner tubing to the inner diameter of the outer tubing) on axial frictional pressure losses. The frictional pressure-loss gradients predicted by the CFD simulations were verified by comparing with the published studies and flow data from a field-scale experimental set-up. At a constant flow rate, it is confirmed that frictional pressure losses decrease with increasing eccentricity. A good agreement was obtained with the Haciislamoglu et al. correlation, and the results of this study, especially at low values of eccentricity. At very high eccentricities, data from the CFD model yield lower frictional pressure loss compared to Haciislamoglu et al. correlation. This type of expression is obtained and the improved data of this study is incorporated. Next, this paper presents the results of an experimental study carried out to investigate frictional pressure-loss behavior of drag-reducing polymer solutions, flowing turbulently through an eccentric annulus. The experimental setup includes 30 ft of 3 1/2 x 2 3/8-in., 200 ft of 3 1/2 x 1 3/4-in., 69 ft of 5 1/2 x 4-in., and 79 ft of 5 x 3 1/2-in. fully eccentric annuli. Data analysis enabled the development of a new correlation using fluid apparent viscosity at 511 sec-1, generalized Reynolds number, and diameter ratio, all of which can be easily determined in the field, as independent variables. These new correlations for laminar and turbulent flow of drag-reducing polymer solutions present an improvement to existing correlations, and also permit undemanding hydraulic-program calculations for varying annular configurations.},

  abstract = {AbstractFrictional pressure loss calculations in narrow annuli of slim-hole and coiled tubing operations require more accuracy than before. The paper describes a method to calculate pressure losses that better represents actual annular configurations.The skewed (vertical wells, varying eccentricity) and uniformly eccentric (deviated wells) geometries are addressed. Easy to use realistic correlations are obtained for laminar, transition and turbulent flow regimes. Experimental flow loop data validate model predictions. A step-by-step procedure is included for field calculations.IntroductionSlimhole drilling and coiled tubing operations involve fluid flow in narrow annular geometries. As field experience and theoretical calculations have shown, decreasing annular clearance completely modifies the distribution of pressure losses in a well : contrary to conventional drilling, the major part of pump pressure-more than 80\% when inner to outer diameter ratio exceeds 0.8-is lost to friction in the annulus. As the resulting equivalent circulating densities (ECD) are much higher than those in conventional wells, formation can be exposed to excessive pressures. Wellbore stability becomes, therefore, an important issue when defining parameters governing annular flow.The current practices for efficient hole cleaning consist of increasing flow rate and/or fluid rheology, which in both cases give higher ECD. In conventional drilling the increase in ECD by annular pressure losses is usually small compared to the hydrostatic pressure gradient. So, wellbore stability and efficient hole cleaning can be guaranteed by independent choices on mud density on the one hand and flow properties on the other,In narrow annular spaces, however, high annular pressure losses may result in ECD values close to or higher than formation fracture gradient. Accurate modeling of annular pressure losses is therefore needed in order to successfully adjust fluid density and rheology to the whole set of drilling parameters.Annular pressure losses depend on fluid rheology, flow regime and the geometry of the annulus, Previous models treat either concentric or eccentric annuli and assume uniformity along the wellbore.Concentric annular flow has received considerable attention, At laminar flow conditions exact models are available for Newtonian, power law and Bingham plastic fluids, Recently, Reed and Pilehvari proposed a model for laminar, transitional and turbulent flows. This model extends well established results on Newtonian and non-Newtonian pipe flow-in particular Dodge and Metzner's work to concentric annular flow.Models also exist for uniformly eccentric annuli in laminar flow, analytical for Newtonian and numerical for non-Newtonian fluids.P. 113\^},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTAn experimental study has been conducted to investigate the effects of eccentricity on friction pressure loss calculations for drilling and stimulation fluids. Reynolds number in the range of 800 to 100,000 allowed the analysis of friction pressure losses of non-Newtonian fluids in both concentric and eccentric annuli in laminar and turbulent flow regimes.Analysis of Fanning friction factors as a function of generalized Reynolds number showed that the effects of eccentricity are significant when annular friction pressure losses are estimated. The results demonstrated that the annular pressure losses in a fully eccentric annulus can be as low as 40\% of the value in concentric annulus. It was observed that the effect of eccentricity is more evident as the fluid concentration increases. From experimental data obtained in this study, new correlations are proposed to calculate friction pressure losses in concentric and eccentric annuli for laminar and turbulent flow regimes. Though not ideal, these new correlations estimate friction losses in annuli much closer than the previously published equations. INTRODUCTIONWhile the problem of fluid flow in concentric annulus has received much attention in the past, only in the last two decades an interest has started for the same problem in an eccentric annulus. If the annular space is concentric, the flow can be analyzed without much difficulty. But if the annular space is eccentric; i.e., the axes of the inner and outer tubes do not coincide with each other, a great deal effort is required. Unfortunately the latter case represents the majority of realistic situations, especially in a deviated well-bore where the drill pipe has a strong tendency to offset toward the low side because of gravitational effects.The determination of the annular flow performance of Non-Newtonian fluids is quite important in the planning and design of the hydraulics program of a well because significant pressure losses can develop in the constrained space. The knowledge of rheological data and methods of predicting pressure losses are the key points to calculate proper pump rates and avoid any obstacle in a normal operation of oil production. Traditionally, friction pressure calculations are useful in determining horsepower requirements, bottomhole treating pressure, and maximum wellhead pressure. An accurate prediction of the friction losses is very important from the economic point of view. Optimizing the friction pressure loss calculations through the well bore annulus allows making an appropriate evaluation of the wellbore hydraulics, which is essential to reduce the problems and avoid high costs of operation.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of pipe eccentricity on friction pressure loss calculations for the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids through concentric and fully eccentric annuli. The paper examines the effect of gel concentration on friction pressure losses for concentric and eccentric annuli. From data gathered by pumping various drilling and stimulation fluids through rough annuli, practical engineering correlations for Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids in laminar and turbulent flow regimes are developed. The results show that friction pressure losses in eccentric annuli can be considerably overestimated if the eccentricity effects are not taken into consideration.LITERATURE REVIEWA great number of studies are available on estimating friction pressure losses in laminar and turbulent flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in concentric annuli. However, very little has been accomplished for the estimation of friction losses in laminar and turbulent flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids through eccentric annuli.},

The creeping flow assumption, on which most of the known applications are based, is critically examined and its limitations are pointed out. Recent results on particle flow, which include the effect of the advection of a downstream wake and are applicable to finite (but small) Reynolds numbers are also presented. The form of the history (Basset) term is discussed, in the light of recent work and its effect on the integrated results of the equation of motion is examined.

The new model dissipation rate equation is based on the dynamic equation of the mean-square vorticity fluctuation at large turbulent Reynolds number. The new eddy viscosity formulation is based on the realizability constraints; the positivity of normal Reynolds stresses and the Schwarz' inequality for turbulent shear stresses. We find that the present model with a set of unified model coefficients can perform well for a variety of flows. The flows that are examined include: (i) rotating homogeneous shear flows; (ii) boundary-free shear flows including a mixing layer, planar and round jets; (iii) a channel flow, and flat plate boundary layers with and without a pressure gradient; and (iv) backward facing step separated flows. The model predictions are compared with available experimental data. The results from the standard k-ϵ eddy viscosity model are also included for comparison. It is shown that the present model is a significant improvement over the standard k-ϵ eddy viscosity model.},

Predictions of the mean axial velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds shear stress, eddy viscosity, and skin friction coefficients are compared to both experimental and direct numerical simulation data. The relative performance of the models is assessed. It has been found that the predictions between the models can vary considerably, particularly for the turbulent kinetic energy, its dissipation rate, and the eddy viscosity.

Due to the complex nature of non-Newtonian fluids, universally accepted flow equations are unavailable. This paper uses the Carreau and modified power law–Cross (MPL-Cross) rheological models to derive pressure drop–flow rate relationships under laminar flow condition. The aim is to develop simple but effective equations that enable accurate estimation of pressure drop for flow in any pipe size using viscometric data. The new relationships compare favourably with experimental data. Furthermore, new Reynolds number and generalized Reynolds number expressions have been defined.},

  abstract = {A model is presented to compute the threshold shear stress for non-cohesive sediment (uniform and non-uniform) motion on a horizontal sedimentary bed, under a unidirectional steady-uniform stream flow. On the basis of hydro-dynamical and micro-mechanical considerations, forces on a solitary sediment particle, resting on a compact bed formed by equal sized sediment particles, under slip-spinning condition were analyzed with the aid of a computational scheme. The experimental data of sediment threshold reported by various investigators were used to calibrate the model making the lift coefficient as a free parameter. An excellent agreement between the present model and the experimental data of uniform sediments was possible owing to the calibration of the model. The computational results are presented in the graphical form where the variation of normalized threshold shear stress with particle Reynolds number for various angles of repose is shown. It is revealed that the threshold shear stress increases with an increase in angle of repose of bed sediment. The results obtained using the present model are compared with the curves proposed by different investigators and also have an agreement with the experimental data of non-uniform sediments. Diagram is presented for the direct estimation of threshold shear stress from the information on sediment size and angle of repose.},

  doi = {10.2118/20925-MS},
  abstract = {This paper presents the findings to date of a research project initiated to investigate drilled cuttings transport in deviated wellbores. The research programme utilises a simulated wellbore to study the mechanisms ofcuttings transport in deviated wells. The cuttings transport column, has been designed to allow easy variation of well geomeuy in terms of annnlar size, deviation angle and pipe eccentricity. The column is also equipped with a variable speed motor/gear system for the simulation of drillpipe rotation. This study has investigated the influence ofa range of variables such as hole angle, fluid rheology, cuttings size, drillpipe eccentricity, circulation rate, annular size, and pipe rotation OIl cuttings transport efficiency using the concept of Minimum Transport Velocity (MTV). This concept presumes that a hole can be efficiently cleaned by either maintaining cuttings rolling or in suspension, if the annular velocity is equal to or greater than a minimum transport velocity for that operational condition. Thus, the lower the minimum transport velocity the easier it is to efficiently clean the hole. The results so far have shown that depending on the level of eccentricity and annular size, fluid rheology as well as flow regime appear to have highest impact on the MTV. With low viscosity cin:ulating fluid, turbulent flow regime seems to predominate for concentric pipes with suspension and rolling attained at low MTV. The use of high viscosity fluids appeared to improve the cuttings transpott further especially at highly deviated angles. The transport efficiency is further enhanced by pipe rotation at various levels of eccentticity. Smaller cuttings appeared to be easier to remove than larger ones. There is however a small exception to this when larger cuttings were found to be much easier to remove at low angles with the use of high viscosity fluids: The experimental results have been compared with the predictedMTV from the computer model concurrently being developed and good agreement has been observed.},

  abstract = {We characterize the flow of a viscous suspension in an inclined channel where the flow is maintained in
a steady state under the competing influences of gravity and an applied pressure drop. The basic model
relies on a diffusive-flux formalism. Such models are common in the literature, yet many of them possess
an unphysical singularity at the channel centreline where the shear rate vanishes. We therefore present a
regularization of the basic diffusive-flux model that removes this singularity. This introduces an explicit
(physical) dependence on the particle size into the model equations. This approach enables us to carry out
a detailed parameter study showing in particular the opposing effects of the pressure drop and gravity.
Conditions for counter-current flow and complete flow reversal are obtained from numerical solutions of
the model equations. These are supplemented by an analytic lower bound on the ratio of the gravitational
force to the applied pressure drop necessary to bring about complete flow reversal.},

This situation is perhaps partly explainable given that in a wide range of
flows of complex fluids characterised by a relaxation time (λ) the use of
simple single characteristic length (L) and velocity scales (U) does indeed
result in identical definitions! In this short article we return to the original
papers to highlight the different effects that the Deborah and Weissenberg

The model can be used in process design from both a fluid mechanics standpoint and a heat transfer standpoint.

  doi = {10.1007/s003970050153},
  abstract = {Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) in solution represents a complex rheological system, since it forms aggregates and associations and hence higher-level structures and, depending on the synthesis, is only found in a molecularly dispersed form in exceptional cases. Rheo-mechanical investigations of the viscoelasticity showed that the Cox-Merz rule is not fulfilled. The aim was therefore to examine whether rheo-optics could be employed to provide more detailed conclusions about the parameters that influence the flow behavior of NaCMC than has hitherto been available with mechanical methods. The flow birefringence, Δn′, rises as the degree of polymerization increases, and exhibits the same dependence on molar mass as does the viscosity: Δn′∝Mw3.4. As the degree of polymerization increases while the shear rate remains constant, the polymer segments become more distinctly aligned in the direction of shear. Hence increasing the degree of polymerization also affects the solution structure, i.e. the interaction of the molecules with one another. The stress-optical rule only applies to a limited extent for this system. The stress-optical coefficient, C, is almost independent of the shear rate, but is strongly influenced by the concentration and attains a limiting value of 3 × 10−8 Pa−1. C was determined for a polymer in dilute solution and the curve obtained also enabled transitions in the solution structure to be recognized.},

In many cases, particle contaminants in an enclosed space are generated from an unsteady source. This investigation used the experimental data from two steady-state cases as well as one transient particle dispersion case in evaluating the performance of five (one steady and four transient) airflow models with the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods. The transient models obtained the mean flow and particle information by averaging them over time. For the models tested in this study, the Eulerian method performed similarly for all five airflow models. The Lagrangian method predicted incorrect particle concentrations with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) methods, but did well with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) models. For unsteady-state particle dispersion, the LES or DES models, along with the Lagrangian method, showed the best performance among all the models tested.},

Further- more, both creep and frequency-sweep measurements showed that the solutions behaved as viscoelastic materi- als above a second critical CMC concentration c** (transition to concentrated solution). The characterization of CMC solutions was completed with a time-dependent viscosity study that showed that the CMC solutions exhibited strong thixotropic behavior, especially at the highest CMC concentrations.},

The reduction in turbulent friction losses by the dilute addition of high–molecular weight polymers to flowing liquids has been extensively studied since the phenomenon was first observed over 60 years ago. Although it has long been reasoned that the dynamical interactions between polymers and turbulence are responsible for DR, it was not until recently that progress had been made to begin to elucidate these interactions in detail. These advancements come largely from numerical simulations of viscoelastic turbulent flows and detailed turbulence measurements in flows of dilute polymer solutions using laser-based optical techniques. This review presents a selective overview of the current state of the numerics and experimental techniques and their impact on understanding the mechanics and prediction of polymer DR. It includes a discussion of areas in which our understanding is incomplete, warranting further study.},

  abstract = {Effective cuttings removal from the wellbore is one of the major challenges in high inclination and horizontal well drilling applications. High circulation rates required in horizontal and extended reach wells to clean the wellbore from cuttings may not be always feasible due to the risk of increasing dynamic bottom hole pressure reaching the fracture limit of the rock. Achieving good hole cleaning while keeping the dynamic bottom hole pressure within the safe operational window is very often the major engineering challenge. A drag reducing fluid with good hole cleaning ability could be a potential solution in this case. Frictional drag reducing polymers are often composed of high molecular weight linear molecules and can be used with water or hydrocarbon based solvents. The main objective of this experimental study is to compare the cuttings transport performances of water and a drag reducing fluid (PHPA polymer based drilling fluid).},

  isbn = {978-1-55563-186-4},
  doi = {10.2118/108005-MS},
  abstract = {Hole cleaning is one of the major considerations at both design and application stages for a drilling operation. This concept is more emphasized as the wellbore inclination is high, and the size of the wellbore flow area is lower. Especially at horizontal or high inclinations, if the fluid velocity is lower than a critical value, a stationary bed develops, which may cause various problems such as high drag, higher probability of pipe stuck, higher hydraulic requirements, etc, if not removed properly. Therefore, it becomes important and essential to identify the critical velocity. This study aims to estimate the critical fluid flow velocity for preventing the development of a stationary bed using empirical correlations that can be used easily at the field. Also, a rough estimation of bed thickness is also introduced if the flow velocity is lower than the critical velocity. For this purpose, extensive cuttings transport experiments with water have been conducted at Middle East Technical University, Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering Department, Cuttings Transport Flow Loop for various inclinations, flow rates and rate of penetrations. The inner pipe is subjected to a sagging, therefore, more realistic annulus representation is achieved. Observations showed that, a stationary bed can be developed even the inclination of the wellbore is down to 50 degrees. Results showed that, the critical velocity could be estimated using the proposed correlations with a reasonable accuracy when compared with the experimental results. Also, for flow velocities less than the critical values, the thickness of the stationary bed can be detected within an error range of ± 10\%. Introduction Efficient removal of cuttings from the wellbore is one of the major considerations during both design and operational stages of a drilling process. Inadequate hole cleaning may give rise to serious drilling problems, like increase in torque and drag, stuck pipe, loose control on density, difficulty when running and cementing casing, etc.1,2. If the situation is not handled properly, these problems can ultimately lead to the loss of a well. A single stuck pipe indicent may cost over million dollar3. To avoid such problems, generated cuttings have to be removed from the wellbore by the help of the drilling fluid. The ability of the fluid to lift such cuttings is generally referred to as carrying capacity of the drilling fluid. The major factors affecting the carrying capacity of drilling fluids may be listed as fluid annular velocity, hole inclination, drilling fluid properties, penetration rate, pipe/hole eccentricity, hole geometry, cuttings properties, and drillpipe rotation speed4. In fact, fluid flow velocity is the dominant drilling variable on hole cleaning due to its direct relation with the shear stress acting on the cuttings bed5. It has been stated that in order to remove cuttings from a horizontal or a deviated wellbore, a sufficient shear stress should be applied on the cuttings bed surface in order to lift the particles and erode the developed bed. Such a lifting process, of course is directly dependent on not only the fluid properties, but also the cuttings properties, like shape, compaction properties, etc5-7. Additionally, it is reported that due to the interaction between the drilling fluids and cuttings, gel formation within the developed cuttings bed occurs, which significantly increases the required shear force needed to erode the bed, and lift the cuttings particles up from the bed6,7. Studies on cuttings transport have been in progress during the past 50 years.2 These studies can separated into two basic approaches: i) empirical and ii) theoretical. Tomren, Iyoho and Azar4 investigated effects of pipe rotation and hole inclination angle, eccentricity, flow regimes on cuttings transport performance. Becker, Azar and Okrajni8 conducted experimental study comparing the effects of fluid rheological parameters (fluid yield point (YP), plastic viscosity (PV), YP/PV ratio, power law exponent, consistency index, etc.) on annular hole cleaning using a large scale flow loop. They pointed out that turbulent flow improved cuttings transport for highly-inclined wellbores, and the effects of fluid rheology dominated at low inclinations. Sifferman and Becker9 stated that the variables influencing cuttings bed thickness were mud annular velocity, mud density, inclination angle, and drillpipe rotation (with the first two being the most important). Sanchez10 examined the effect of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning during directional well drilling. He observed that bed erosion was improved with pipe rotation. He noted that pipe rotation also caused irregularities in bed thickness along the test section. Yu et al11 proposed a new approach to improve the cuttings transport capacity of drilling fluid in horizontal and inclined wells by attaching gas bubbles to the surface of drilled cuttings using chemical surfactants.},

  abstract = {A new approach of three-layer flow of two-phase (solid-liquid) fluid in annulus, i.e. a stationary bed of drilled cuttings at bottom; a moving bed layer above it; and a heterogeneous suspension layer at the top, is proposed to predict and interpret the cuttings transport mechanism. This new mathematical model is presented to overcome the limitation in the existing two-layer models. This enables efficient prediction of cuttings transport during horizontal drilling using coiled tubing. In particular, the model described in this paper formulates transport process and includes the relevant parameters such as rheological characteristics of the drilling fluid, cuttings size/sphericity/ concentration, wellbore geometry, eccentricity of the coiled tubing, and pumping rate of the drilling fluid. This paper presents the model development, solution, and simulation of the cutting transport process to illustrate the steps involved in determining the effect of each parameter during the drilling operation. Graphical charts and developed correlations between annular flow rate, rheology, wellbore geometry, eccentricity, cuttings size and concentration in each layer, and the carrying capacity are also presented. The simulation results show how to obtain a reasonable pumping velocity of drilling fluid with the possible lowest pressure gradient that might serve as an operational guideline during drilling. Furthermore, the effects of parameters affecting the efficiency of cutting transport are discussed. These results are compared with published experimental data. The observed agreement and discrepancies are discussed, and further improvements on the current model are proposed.},

  abstract = {The major differences between conventional rotary drilling and coiled-tubing drilling
are the absence of drill pipe rotation and continuous circulation of drilling fluid. In rotary
drilling, the circulated drilling fluid must be capable of cleaning the face of the drill bit
and transport the drilled cuttings effectively to the surface without cuttings bed fonnation
to ensure adequate wellbore cleaning performance. For effective cuttings transport and
hole cleaning to be achieved, it is significant for the fluid to be injected at very high flow
rates which may result in wall erosion. However, depending on the operational drilling
conditions, very-high fluid velocities are needed to minimize the drag and frictional
forces. Notwithstanding, the vibration and torque on the wellbore fluid (mixture of
cuttings and air) due to drill pipe rotation is very significant. In this study, wellbore
hydraulics (i.e. annular pressure drop) due to drill pipe rotation was investigated in air
drilling operation. A model was developed, solved using MATLAB and validated by
comparing developed and Adewunmi and Supon (1989) model predictions. The result
showed that the annular pressure drop due to rotation was 4.2\% lower than that of drilling
operation without drill pipe rotation. Also, sensitivity analysis of the drilling operating
system was carried out using Rate of Penetration, Cutting size, Hole size and Injected air

The model is base don the critical deposition velocity concept used in the pipeline slurry transport. The Oroskar and Turian expression, a mechanistic model for slurry transport in pipes, is extended to the problem of cuttings transport in the eccentric annuli of inclined oil wells. The model allows the computation of the critical flow rate and the cuttings bed height under various conditions of hole angle and size, drilling fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) and drilling rate. Predicted critical flow rates and bed heights, as a function of inclination angle, rate of penetration and mud rheology are compared to experimental data from two different large scale flow loops (5-inch and 8-inch outer diameters). The results indicate that the proposed model is a viable technique, although it requires further development and modification to include the effects of cuttings hold up and of distribution of turbulent eddy sizes in the annulus.},

  abstract = {An experimental study of cuttings transport with foam at intermediate angles has been conducted in a full-scale Low Pressure-Ambient Temperature (LPAT) flow loop at The University of Tulsa. An anionic surfactant was used in these water base foam tests at a concentration of 1\% v/v. Air was used as dispersed fluid. Rheological tests were conducted to obtain flow curves for foams with 70\% and 80\% qualities in 2", 3" and 4" pipes. A simulator was developed to predict pressure, flow velocity, specific volume expansion ratio and foam quality along the wellbore based on the volume equalized power law model.Tests were conducted to determine the effects of inclination angle, foam quality, foam velocity and rate of penetration on cuttings transport. Results from this study show that the in situ cuttings concentration ranged, according to the inclination angles, from 4.8\% to 14.6\% for 45 degrees, 14.3\% to 22.3\% for 55 degrees and 8.5\% to 25.7\% for 65 degrees. It is shown in this study that the transport of cuttings (in terms of cuttings concentration) has a better performance with foams of low quality. For a given inclination angle and similar foam flow conditions, increasing the rate of penetration from 20 ft/hr to 44 ft/hr can lead to an increase in the in situ cuttings concentration of up to 7\%.A new correlation for the ratio of the cuttings bed area to the cross sectional area of the annulus as a function of dimensionless numbers (Ar, Re, Fr, Ss and ?) was developed and allows for pontential practical applicaitons. The differences between the calculated and measured values are within a range of ±17\%.IntroductionFoam has a variety of applications in the oil and gas industry. Particularly, foam can be used as a lightweight drilling fluid in under balanced drilling applications. Drilling with foam has been shown to provide significant benefits including increased drilling rate, minimization of lost circulation, reduction of differential pipe sticking and reduced formation damage. Foam also has potential applications in deepwater drilling operations.The rheological behavior of foams plays a key role in determining the efficiency of cuttings transport in drilling operations. Although great efforts have been made1-10 to model the rheology of foams, there is an apparent disagreement among investigators in selecting the best model for describing the flow behavior of foam. Due to the complexity of foams, the resulting models frequently contained parameters that are difficult or impossible to measure and hence of limited applicability.Valko et al.11 introduced the "Volume Equalized Principle" based upon the concept of constant friction factor (Reynolds Number) along the flow line. In practice, the principle states that all shear stress-shear rate data points obtained from isothermal experiments under different geometries and qualities (due to different volumetric inlet gas/liquid ratios or quality changes along a pipe) lie on a single curve if both the shear stresses and shear rates are volume equalized. Under this concept, the volume equalized rheological models are written as below:Power Law Volume Equalized:Equation 1Bingham Plastic Volume Equalized:Equation 2Hershel-Bulckley Volume Equalized:Equation 3Saintpere et al.12 reported that the Herschel Bulkley number can be a good indicator of carrying capacity. They suggested that the dimensionless parameter "characteristic time" provided an estimate of the necessary circulating time for hole cleaning. They also observed the worst hole cleaning efficiency at angles between 40° to 60°.Martins et al.13,14 conducted experimental and modeling studies to predict cuttings transport performance in horizontal and inclined wells. Results show that an increase in total flow rate helps bed erosion and higher liquid flow rates always result in better hole cleaning.},

  abstract = {Inadequate hole cleaning during a drilling operation may result in immediate problems such as excessive torque or pack-off situations, or it can lead to delayed problems such as while running in hole with a casing/liner or a completion string in a leftover cuttings bed. It is therefore desirable to provide quantitative information about hole cleaning conditions: at the planning stage, while drilling or when investigating incidents.

Because the ability to transport cuttings particles varies with their position in the borehole and the current drilling parameters, hole cleaning modelling is a history-dependent problem. The precise modelling of the movement of solid particles during a drilling operation gives the possibility to estimate whether they are in suspension in the drilling fluid, settling on the low side or being eroded from a cuttings bed. These estimations may be confirmed through the change of the active volume or by the increase of downhole pressure, when PWD (Pressure While Drilling) measurements are available.

A transient cuttings transport model has been used for planning and monitoring an ERD (Extended Reach Drilling) well drilled in the North Sea. The model has been used to compare the expected performance of different mud systems on both hydraulic and mechanical limits that could be expected prior to drilling. For another challenging drilling operation, the model has been used to post analyze the sequence of actions that led to problems while running in hole with a liner. Here also, the observations tended to confirm the predictions made by the hole cleaning model.

Furthermore, an active use of such an advanced hole cleaning model may help determine the time required for circulation procedures prior to pull out of hole. This can help reduce the flat time associated with circulation procedures and at the same time decrease the duration by which the hole stays open thus reducing the risk of hole instability.},

  abstract = {The use of drilling foams is increasing because foams exhibit properties that are desirable in many drilling operations. A good knowledge of cuttings transport efficiency under downhole conditions is essential for safe and economical foam drilling. Previous cuttings transport studies with foam are limited to low pressure and ambient temperature conditions. No experimental study has been conducted under downhole (i.e., elevated pressure and temperature) conditions. This paper presents an experimental study of cuttings transport with foam in a horizontal annulus under simulated downhole conditions. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of polymer additives, foam quality, flow velocity, temperature, and pressure on foam cuttings transport. Experiments were carried out at elevated pressures (100 to 400 psi) and temperature (80?to 170 degrees F) conditions in a unique full-scale flow loop with a 73-ft long test section (5.76 × 3.5 in. concentric annulus). A field-tested commercial foam system consisting of surfactant (1\% v/v) and hydroxylethylcellulose polymer (HEC) was used in the experiments. Three different polymer concentrations (0.0, 0.25, and 0.5\% v/v) were tested. Foam quality was varied from 70 to 90\%. During a test, cuttings were injected continuously to the flow loop until a steady state condition was established in the test section. In-situ cuttings volumetric concentration (i.e., the ratio of the volume of cuttings in the suspension and the cuttings bed to the volume of the annulus) in the test section was determined using nuclear densitometers, load cell measurements, and by weighing cuttings flushed out of the flow loop. Test parameters recorded during the experiments were: liquid and gas injection rates, cuttings weight in injection and removal towers, mixture density, friction pressure loss, and pressure and temperature in the annulus. Two flow patterns, stationary cuttings bed, and fully suspended flow, were observed during the cuttings transport tests. The flow pattern depends on polymer concentration, foam quality, and annular velocity. Annular flow velocity, foam quality, and polymer concentration all affect cuttings transport efficiency and frictional pressure loss. This paper will help to better design foam drilling and cleanup operations. Introduction Foam is a highly attractive alternative over conventional drilling fluid because it has low density and flexibility in ECD control. However, it is difficult to obtain reliable predictions of ECD for foam drilling because of the complexity of foam flows. When drill cuttings are present in the wellbore, the foam-cuttings mixture affects bottomhole pressure (BHP) and this makes the already complicated compressible foam flow even more complex. Therefore, cuttings transport with foam should be well understood for accurate BHP and ECD estimations. In short, a good knowledge of foam hydraulics and cuttings transport is necessary for safe and economical drilling. Studies on cuttings transport using foam fluids are very limited. Though cuttings in foam affect hydraulics calculations and ECD predictions, it is generally accepted that foam is very efficient in cuttings transport in vertical wells. Foam flow velocity with 120 ft/min is sufficient for most vertical well foam drilling; in some cases, flow velocity as low as 70 ft/min has been reported successful. For foam drilling in horizontal wells, the situation is quite different compared with that in vertical wells because the particle settling velocity is perpendicular to foam flow direction so that drill cuttings tend to settle to the low side of the wellbore; and the density of drill cuttings is much higher than the density of foam. As a result, the mechanisms that govern cuttings transport are different for horizontal wells. Empirical correlations and models developed for vertical wells may not be valid for horizontal and inclined wellbores (Chen 2005). Although experiments on cuttings transport with foam in horizontal wells with a large-scale flow loop have been conducted recently (Ozbayoglu 2002; Capo 2002; Martins et al. 2000; Miska et al. 2004), tests were performed under low pressure and ambient temperature conditions. No experiments have been conducted on cuttings transport with foam under elevated pressure and temperature conditions. Therefore, this research project is unique in terms of cuttings transport with foam. There is a definite need for this kind of study to better understand cuttings transport with foam in simulated downhole conditions, and for more reliable BHP and ECD predictions.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a new mathematical model to overcome the limitations in existing hydraulic models used to predict cuttings transport in coiled tubing horizontal or deviated well drilling. A new three-segment (a horizontal and near horizontal segment, a vertical and near vertical segment, and a transit segment) hydraulic model under two-phase (solid-liquid) flow in an annulus was developed to predict and interpret cuttings transport mechanisms. In particular, the model developed in this study advances a three-layer (a stationary bed layer of drilled cuttings at the bottom, a moving bed layer above it, and a heterogeneous suspension layer at the top) hydraulic model for the horizontal and near horizontal segment. An existing two-layer model was modified for a transit segment, and a one-layer model was used for the vertical and near vertical segment. 

This paper specifically describes model development for each segment, solution, and the simulation results of the integrated three-segment model. The simulation results show how to obtain a reasonable pumping velocity and optimize the rheology of drilling fluid with the possible lowest pressure gradient that might serve as an operational guideline during drilling. Moreover, the effects of various parameters that affect the efficiency of cuttings transport are discussed. These results were compared with published experimental data. The observed agreement and discrepancies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Among the costs considered on an oil field exploration, the drilling process related ones constitute a significant share. Consequently, the focus on the removal of cuttings generated by the drilling process, or the hole cleaning operation, is essential. This operation remains a critical issue in the drilling of high inclination-wells, since the cuttings tend to deposit themselves due to gravity's action, forming a bed in the annular space formed between the drill string and the casing. When this bed takes a sizable fraction of the annular space, it becomes responsible for many problems that appear on the drilling stage, such as premature bit's exhaustion, low rates of penetration, formation fracture, stuck pipe, fluid flow interruption, etc. If this situation is not treated properly, it may cause the loss of the well. Once the phenomena affecting cuttings transportation, bottom hole pressures and ECD prediction are time dependents, a transient model for the whole trajectory of the wellbore was build. This model can predict the pressures developed in the annular due to the phenomenon that occurs in the drilling process, like bed height increase/decrease, drillpipe movement (surge and swab), increase in the amount of solids caused by rock instability problems and operational parameters changes (increase/decrease in ROP and fluid flow rates). This paper objective is to present a new transient methodology to simulate the cutting's carrying and annular pressure evaluation on a transient approach and to present some examples of this model. These examples will showcase bed height, cuttings concentration, pressure and ECD curves along time and over the whole trajectory, due to changes in the parameters mentioned above. Introduction Transport of cuttings has been one of the greatest concerns in the oil well drilling. An investigation undertook by Massie et al. (1995) showed that 70\% of the time lost with unexpected events was associated with stuck pipe. A study done by Hopkins and Leicksenring (1995) presented that a third of the problems of stuck pipe were due to inadequate hole cleaning. The problem of drilled cuttings transported by fluid is a theme of interest of several industrial areas, such as: petroleum, mining, among others. Basically, the solids, since they are denser than the fluid, tend to be transported with a lower velocity than the medium velocity of the fluid. In the past, this type of analysis was accomplished without taking into account the transient effects that had happened during the drilling stage, as in the works of Iyoho (1980), Gavignet and Sobey (1986), Martins (1990), Campos (1994), Pilevari et al. (1996). A more realistic representation of the phenomena requires a detailed process simulation, including transient effects. Simulations in turn allow the introduction of disturbances in the variables at any instant of time, permitting the reproduction of field conditions, such as: change in the flow rate, alteration in the drilling fluid, increase in the amount of solids to be carried and progression in the hole cleaning process. Pressure variations taking place in the annular due to the interruption and the retaking of circulation and the drillstring trip and ECD variations along the annular can also be evaluated in a transient methodology.},

There has been no single predictive tool developed to address pipe rotation effects on foam drilling. This paper presents the first study of cuttings transport using foam with pipe rotation under simulated downhole conditions. A field-scale, high-pressure/high-temperature wellbore simulator with a 73-ft-long, 5.76 x 3.5-in. eccentric annular test section was used to investigate the effects of pipe rotation, foam quality and velocity, downhole pressure and temperature on cuttings transport, and pressure losses in a horizontal wellbore. Experiments were conducted with backpressures from 100 to 400 psi and temperatures from 80 to 160°F. Pipe rotary speeds were varied from 0 to 120 RPM, with foam qualities ranging from 60 to 90\% and foam velocities from 2 to 5 ft/sec. It was found that pipe rotation not only significantly decreases cuttings concentration in a horizontal annulus but also results in a considerable reduction in frictional pressure loss. The reduction in cuttings concentration is up to 40\% at a medium foam velocity (3 ft/sec) when pipe is rotated up to 120 RPM. The decrease in frictional pressure loss is up to 50\% at a medium foam velocity and is more than 60\% at a low velocity. Using a higher foam velocity or quality also improves hole cleaning; however, pressure losses are significantly increased. A mechanistic model and an associated computer simulator were developed for practical design and field applications. It can be used to predict cuttings concentration, bed height, and pressure drop during horizontal foam drilling with various pipe rotary speeds, eccentricities, foam qualities, and velocities under different pressure and temperature conditions. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental results show that the difference is less than 15\% in most of the cases.},

  title = {Transport of {{Small Cuttings}} in {{Extended}}-{{Reach Drilling}}},
  volume = {23},
  doi = {10.2118/104192-PA},
  abstract = {Field experience has shown that inefficient transport of small cuttings is a main factor for excessive drag and torque during extended-reach drilling; however, very little is known about the transport behavior of small cuttings. In this study, extensive experiments with three sizes of cuttings (0.45 to 3.3 mm) were conducted in a field-scale flow loop (8 in.×4.5 in., 100-ft long) to identify the main factors affecting small cuttings transport. The effects of cuttings size, drillpipe rotation, fluid rheology, flow rate, and hole inclination were investigated. The results show significant differences in cuttings transport based on cuttings size. Smaller cuttings result in a higher cuttings concentration than larger cuttings in a horizontal annulus when tested with water. However, a lower concentration was achieved for smaller cuttings when 0.25-ppb polyanionic cellulose (PAC) solutions were used. Unlike the transport of large cuttings, which is mainly dominated by fluid flow rate, the key factors controlling small cuttings transport were found to be pipe rotation and fluid rheology. Improvement by pipe rotation in the transport efficiency of small cuttings is up to twice as large as the improvement in large cuttings transport. Compared with water, PAC solutions significantly improve smaller cuttings transport, while the transport of larger cuttings is only slightly enhanced. Mathematical modeling was performed to develop correlations for cuttings concentration and bed height in an annulus for field applications. Predictions from a three-layer model previously developed for larger cuttings were also compared with experimental results. Differences (up to 80\%) indicate the need for improving the frequently used three-layer model by including correlations specifically developed for small cuttings to get a better design of extended-reach drilling. This study is also useful for horizontal or high-angle well drilling and completion through sand reservoirs. Introduction Efficient cuttings transport is a major challenge when a long extended-reach well with a horizontal and highly inclined section of more than 20 thousand feet is drilled (Guild et al. 1995; Gao and Young 1995; Schamp et al. 2006). Cuttings can be ground to finer sand while being transported out of the hole, especially when rotary drilling is used. Drilling may not be able to proceed if cuttings transport remains a problem in such a hole. Because of excessive drag and torque caused by small cuttings settled at the lower side of the horizontal or inclined section, it may not be possible to run casing in place even if drilling to the target depth can be achieved. Similar problems exist in horizontal and highly inclined wells drilled through unconsolidated sand reservoirs. Field practice and experimental observations (Parker 1987; Larsen 1990; Gavignet and Sobey 1989; Ahmed 2001; Bassal 1995) show that smaller cuttings are more difficult to transport under certain conditions. Moreover, smaller particles tend to more easily stick a drillpipe because of their cohesive effects (Ahmed 2001; Gailani et al. 2001). It is even more difficult to release the pipe once it is stuck by small, sand-sized cuttings. An investigation into previous studies in the area of hole cleaning and sand transport shows that very limited information is available for small cuttings transport under drilling conditions. Though different cuttings have been tested by several investigators (Parker 1987; Larsen 1990; Ahmed 2001; Bassal 1995; Ford et al. 1990; Peden et al. 1990; Martins et al. 1996), no study has been conducted on small cuttings transport in horizontal or high-angle annuli involving drillpipe rotation. Previous conclusions about the cuttings size effects on cuttings transport are quite diverse, and even contradictory in some cases (Parker 1987; Larsen 1990; Gavignet and Sobey 1989; Ahmed 2001; Ford et al. 1990; Peden et al. 1990; Martins et al. 1996). Their experiments, upon which these conclusions are based, were conducted under incomparable conditions. It may not be correct, or at least not safe, to state explicitly that smaller cuttings are harder or easier to transport. The result may depend on various combinations of drilling parameters. This study was undertaken to understand why and under what conditions they are harder or easier to transport.},

  abstract = {Effective removal of small, sand-sized solids is critical for successful drilling and completion operations in sand reservoirs. Recent experience in extended-reach drilling also indicates that inefficient transport of smaller cuttings is a main factor for excessive drag and torque. This study was undertaken to determine two critical conditions for efficient transport of small solids. The two conditions are represented by the critical resuspension velocity (CRV), the minimum fluid velocity necessary to initiate solids-bed erosion, and the critical deposition velocity (CDV), the minimum fluid velocity required to prevent bed formation. Experiments were conducted in a field-scale flow loop (8 × 4.5 in., 100 ft long) to determine CRV and CDV for 0.45-mm and 1.4-mm sands in different fluids over a range of bed heights and hole inclinations. The results show that, depending on sand size and fluid properties, CDV is approximately two to three times larger than CRV. Water is more effective than low-concentration polymer solutions for bed erosion. However, polymer solutions are more helpful than water in preventing bed formation. This indicates the need for different drilling fluids for cleanout and drilling operations. A mechanistic model was developed to predict CRV for a solids bed. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate the importance of interparticle forces that are incorporated into the model. The model accounts for drillpipe eccentricity in any direction in an annulus, which is consistent with experimental observations. The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental results. Existing CDV correlations developed for larger cuttings were verified by experimental data for sands. The differences are approximately 25\%. Results in this study will be useful not only in drilling and completion through sand reservoirs, but also in extended-reach drilling and sand control.},

  abstract = {Modern drilling programs require a variety of drilling equipment over a variety of well paths. Changes in equipment and parameters greatly affect the process of cuttings transport in the wellbore. While extensive experimental work has explored a multitude of drilling parameters, a firm methodology for using computational fluid dynamics to model this process has not been established. Moreover, computational models more easily compare different drilling geometries than experimental apparatuses that require significant equipment exchange. This thesis first establishes a methodology for utilizing computational fluid dynamics to model cuttings transport in a drilling annulus. The results establish qualitatively comparable results to prior experimental work. Therefore, the tool is made useful by isolating and studying the effects of changing parameters. The second part of the thesis consists of a parameter study to determine effects of drill pipe rotation, drilling fluid velocity, drill pipe eccentricity, wellbore inclination, and rate of penetration on cuttings accumulation over different drill pipe and borehole sizes. Results include both individual parameter effects as well as combined effects of the parameters in a single scenario, some of which suggest more complex mechanisms of cuttings transport than previously postulated.},

  abstract = {How good are your models? Can they be used to improve your drilling processes? These are questions often posed in relation to real-time model applications, including models integrated with drilling control. Do the models fulfill requirements with regards to accuracy and calculation speed? Can the data be applied by the models to both interpret the state of the process and provide reliable input for calculations? Can the rig equipment be used safely and securely to control the processes? This paper seeks to answer these questions and further elaborate on current activities and near-term challenges in drilling automation. While static models are generally accepted, the use of dynamic models is emerging. In real-time model applications, it has been found that rig equipment analysis is necessary to assess applicability or upgrading requirements. Controlling machines for drilling operations using outputs from models has been successfully achieved. This paper provides examples of recent developments within drilling automation, drawing from applications of closed-loop control systems in the North Sea. Challenges regarding interpreting state-of-the-process are discussed, with respect to existing rig instrumentation, while examining the need for enhanced surface and downhole sensors. Mathematical models used with the drilling control system must communicate regularly with the drilling process to extract information from sensors and provide updated control commands for automation. How sensor data is applied through models to enable automation functionality is also illustrated. Introduction Instrumentation arrived fairly early in the drilling business, as drillers developed new ways to monitor the well drilling beneath them. Steam-pressure gauges were quickly followed by drilling-fluid pressure gauges. By the late 1920s, the weight indicator appeared, giving the driller the first look at the drillstring interaction with the wellbore. These early sensors were used in real time to monitor current conditions while drilling. With the advent of chart recorders, drilling trends could be more easily recognized. When computers were introduced to the industry, data could be recorded with more accuracy, and output could be displayed in real time or archived for post-well review. With data interchange protocols and satellite telecommunication systems, virtually all the parameters from surface and sub-surface sensors can be viewed in near real time around the globe. As monitoring gave way to trending, trending is now yielding the stage to dynamic modeling. The question is whether the nature of the sensors and the methods used for data processing kept pace with the way the data is used today. Real-time drilling process models have developed from simplified steady-state models incorporating the physics of single-phase fluid flow and static drillstring torque and hook load, used primarily for planning and decision-making purposes, to more advanced dynamic models having increasing complexity with regards to process details. Today's models address such drilling dynamics as drillstring mechanics and vibrations, temperature modeling and multiphase flow including high-accuracy multiple fluid and cuttings transport calculations. These dynamic drilling models in turn enable new types of model-enabled control functionalities such as advanced managed pressure drilling, dual-gradient applications, rate of penetration (ROP) optimization and automatic safeguarding of the drilling process with regards to well and rig limitations. The complexity of the model equations increases as more effects are taken into account, and the number and complexity of required sub-models and correlations are increasing to achieve the level of complexity required as the model results are linked closer and closer to control of the drilling procedure, from advisory to physical constraints and up to the point of automatic control of the drilling machinery.},

  abstract = {This project was performed on behalf of SINTEF Materials and Chemistry in close collaboration
with Lyng Drilling, part of the Schlumberger Group. The scope of the project has been to
develop a method for geometry and setup simplifications on a Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) simulation made on a drill bit at work; to see if there is a possibility to implement this
type of simulations as a step in the product development process of drill bits at the company Lyng
Drilling. This in order to establish the local flow-patterns around the drill bit, that governs among
other things how the cuttings is transported away and the cooling of the drill bit. The drill bits
often have a pattern of surface erosion, caused by an increased intensity and velocity of the flow
at that area. Zones with low flow velocity, stagnation points, can cause problems to the drilling
as cuttings and mud can get stuck there subsequently leading to clogging of the drill head and
increased energy required for the overall drilling. The only success on simulating the mud flow
around the drill bit was obtained with transient simulations on a stationary drill bit. A rotating
case was simulated with dynamic mesh, but simulation time was estimated to exceed 6 months,
and this scenario was one of the limitations set initially in the project.
No industrial gain can be obtained by implementing CFD-simulations as a step in the product development
process for the design of drill bits at Lyng Drilling. The simulations are far too complex
and require a lot of work and simulation time, as well as the parameter assumptions are too many.},

  doi = {https://doi.org/10.2118/135703-MS},
  shorttitle = {{{SPE}}-135703-{{MS}}},
  abstract = {The drilling industry has long had problems with debris left in the hole after completion of drilling and prior to a trip or to the running of a casing string or a production liner. Debris left in the hole can also lead to poor cement bonding with the formation. This problem can be especially bad in high angle or horizontal wellbores, where often large quantities of the debris can accumulate on the low side of the hole, thereby creating a lengthy interval potential cleaning problems.

Historically the industry has used centralizers and other tools to achieve a certain level of stand-off, whereby the axial flow of drilling fluid or completion fluids can flow past the debris and slowly remove the unwanted solids accumulation. The rotation of drill pipe to aid in wellbore cleanout has been used for many years, but the question of ‘how fast??? remains. In addition, many other ‘creative' techniques have been tried in order to solve the problem, sometimes with some success and other times with little success. However, no model specific for wellbore cleanout in cases such as this exists.

In the last few years, the modeling of drill pipe rotation in drilling situations has advanced to the point where the helical flow characteristics of non-Newtonian drilling fluids can now be mapped in an annulus subject to axial and rotational flow. The axial and tangential velocities can be coupled to produce the annular point velocities for concentric and eccentric geometry. In this work, the velocity modeling is applied to predict wellbore cleanout efficiency for various particle sizes as functions of fluid shear stress in the annular flow stream and drillpipe rotation speed. Results will show rotational speeds required for the cleanout of small particles such as sand and for much larger-sized drilled cuttings.},

  abstract = {Coil tubing (CT) technology has been in use in the oil and gas industry since the 1990s. Since then, the applications of CT have expanded rapidly. Coiled tube drilling can offer more efficient and faster drilling operations resulting in lower operational costs. Micro-borehole CT drilling (CTD) has been used in oil and gas applications and is very attractive as a method for minerals exploration drilling due to the faster drilling i.e. high rate of penetration (ROP) that can be achieved resulting in reduced drilling costs. Due to the narrow annulus space there is a certain degree of uncertainty with regards to cuttings transport. In this paper we review the fluid flow and cutting transport models available for conventional drilling. Different aspects of fluid flow in micro-borehole CT will be addressed and discussed. The discussion illustrates the important parameters, including fluid properties, cuttings properties, fluid hydraulics and annular geometry affecting cutting transports in micro-borehole CT drilling in oil and gas as well as mineral exploration.

  url = {http://www.mred.tuc.gr/home/kelessidis/publications/10.pdf},
  abstract = {Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) has grown significantly in recent years as a niche market for drilling jobs considered not good candidates for conventional rotary drilling due primarily to high cost associated with them. CTD is normally associated with high angle to horizontal and extended reach wells. It is, however, in these applications that hole problems, due to inefficient cuttings removal, become more troublesome. These problems are enhanced due to the non rotation of the inner string (the CT itself) as opposed to normal (or conventional) drilling where the inner pipe rotation imparts some motion and agitation of the drilled solids thus minimizing hole problems due to cuttings accumulation. Many parameters affect efficient cuttings transport in Coil Tubing Drilling in horizontal and deviated geometries. Among these are pump rates, well dimensions, fluid properties, solids sizes and solids loading. Drilling should be designed and carried out so that all cuttings are maintained in suspension and no cuttings bed is formed. Several attempts have been made to determine the optimum operating range of these parameters but complete and satisfactory models have yet to be developed. The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the state of the art of previous approaches to efficient cuttings transport during Coil Tubing Drilling, present the critical parameters involved and establish their range according to what is observed in practice through dimensional and similarity analysis. Finally the laboratory system that has already been set up is presented. Its primary purpose is to allow the gathering of good quality data, which are really missing from the literature, which could aid into better understanding the flow of solid – liquid mixtures in annuli.},

However, poor hole cleaning often occurred in the highly-deviated sections and horizontal sections of the complex structural wells, which affects rate of penetration, cementing quality and downhole safety. It is advisable to study the behavior of cuttings transport under different conditions. In general, experimental observations and CFD simulations are main methods to analyze the effects of cutting parameters, fluid parameters and operational parameters on hole cleaning. The correlations and models are applied to predict the number of cuttings and the critical velocity in the annulus. In this paper, an analysis of key parameters is conducted on cuttings transport, the existing problems and characteristics of these correlations and models are summarized, and different removal methods of annular cuttings and future research needs are discussed. Although major improvements have been achieved in the past several decades, how to accurately predict the cuttings bed height, critical velocity and other key parameters, and to effectively solve the poor hole cleaning still is a difficulty challenge. Therefore, more research will be conducted to further understand cuttings transport mechanism in multi-factors coupling and complex wellbore conditions.},

Recent work on particle settling velocity has accelerated the understanding of the behaviour of drilled cuttings in wellbores.

This paper presents a new model to the industry, which combines recent developments in the fields of particle settling and rheology. This model provides a useful tool for the planning of hole cleaning for highly deviated wells through the use of Lift Factors under the eccentric drillpipe Information from deviated wells in the field is used to illustrate the usefulness of this hole cleaning model. Importantly, analysis of the data indicates that fluid 'n' factors calculated using the yield-power law [Herschel-Bulkley] rheological model play a greater role in promoting good hole cleaning in ERD wells than has previously been recognised.},

  abstract = {Coiled tubing (CT) drilling has grown tremendously in the last few years. In spite of the many technological advances that have accompanied this growth, one significant remaining challenge is effective cuttings transport, particularly in deviated wells. This paper presents a summary of cuttings transport problems and current solutions (including fluid selection, flow rates, and operational techniques such as short trips and pumping viscous slugs). It is shown that in many circumstances hole cleaning is more efficient if a low-viscosity fluid is pumped in turbulent flow rather than a high-viscosity fluid in laminar flow. Several detailed case studies are presented that illustrate both severe cuttings transport problems and routine applications without cuttings transport difficulties. The proposed hole cleaning models are used to interpret these data and suggest possible alternative approaches.

Hole cleaning relying on viscous fluids in laminar flow has proved to be inefficient because of the inability to rotate the string to agitate bedded cuttings. Alternatively, a high flow rate for turbulent hole cleaning is more effective, but difficult to achieve because of high friction pressures in the coiled tubing. Therefore, a cuttings bed is almost always present in CT (or any slide) drilling. This has a major operational impact resulting from required remedial activities, increased risk of stuck pipe and the inability to attain the desired reach.

Two novel approaches to understanding hole cleaning are introduced. First, for laminar flow, the distance that a particle will travel (downstream) before it falls across the annulus clearance is calculated using Stokes' law and the local viscosity while flowing. This analysis may be easily applied to optimize mud selection and wiper trips. Applying this model to high low-shear-rate-viscosity (LSRV) gels shows that they may perform well inside casing but are expected to do a poor job of hole cleaning in a narrow openhole horizontal annul us without rotation. Second, for turbulent flow in horizontal wells, the concept of using annular velocity (AV) as a measure of hole cleaning is shown to be insufficient. A more complete term called AVRD is introduced, which is the product of the AV and the square root of the hydraulic diameter. This term should be used to compare cuttings transport in turbulent flow in horizontal wells of different cross sectional areas.

  abstract = {A mechanical packer and abrasive perforator, conveyed by Coiled tubing(CT), grants great flexibility to the design of an annular fracturing treatment. On the downside the solids from a previous fracture treatment, or abrasive perforation cut, can be picked up by the subsequent pad fluid leading to a screen out. This is complicated by the fact that tolerance to solids varies between formations. To avoid this, solids transport during abrasive perforating, fracturing, displacement, and cleaning must be considered. Unique to this analysis is the ability to model the distribution of solids at any point in time, and the subsequent pick up of solids by the clean pad fluid. This leads to an unprecedented job optimization opportunity for reservoirs that can tolerate some solids in the initial pad stage, and risk mitigation for those which can't. The model considers a transient mass balance for the solids bed and slurry. Non-uniform distribution of solids in the slurry is considered, which means the solids are not transported with the average slurry velocity. A drift flux model relates solids velocity in the slurry to the average slurry velocity. The difference between these is described by two terms. The first term accounts for variation in the cross sectional profiles of liquid velocity and solids concentration. This considers turbulent diffusion, settling velocity, and a liquid velocity profile based on Prandtl mixing length theory. The second term accounts for the interaction of gravity and buoyancy. Experiments to measure cleaning time involved a transparent pipe with a smaller pipe located eccentrically inside and a known amount of solids. Water is then injected through the smaller pipe and circulated in the annulus to clean the solids. The time required to remove all solids from the annulus is measured for a number of deviation angles and flow rates. Simulation results are compared to experimental data at all deviation angles. A field case is presented for a well that initially screened out during the pad after abrasive perforating. Finally a sample simulation details the solids transport for the entire process and a cleanout that was required following a screen out in the fracturing stage. This highlights how the model can be used to predict the axial distribution of solids in coiled tubing and wellbore at any time, for uphill and downhill flows, at all deviation angles.},

It mainly focuses on theoretical studies. An overview of the experimental study of solids transport is given in a companion paper (Li et al. 2014). The methodology used to develop a model to simulate the hole cleaning process is also discussed. To date, completely satisfactory solids transport software, is still not available for the oil industry. Hopefully, this paper will provide a useful and helpful general guide for future research related to this subject and will aid in a better understanding of the lack of previous studies and what issues should be focused on in future research. Introduction The transport of solids is encountered in various industries which include the mining (Wilson et al. 2006), sedimentation (García, 2008), oil transport, well drilling, well cementing, well completion, and well intervention and production applications.~ Coal water slurry, iron ore, mineral concentrate, sand removal, limestone or cement kiln feeding in the cement industry, dredging and tailings disposal and heavy bitumen transport are examples of typical slurry hydraulic transport in a pipeline. ~Figure 1 shows the proppant image which was taken from a downhole camera after a fracturing job in a horizontal wellbore. The sand bed is in the form of dunes that has to be cleaned out the wellbore before the well can start to produce. Otherwise the sands could block the perforations and reduce the production rate. In some cases if the sands are not cleaned out before the production, a high production rate could clean the well. However, once the sand enters the surface lines, it could cause erosion problems for the surface pipeline and other equipment. The cuttings transport in a conventional drilling application involves a drilling period and a hole-cleaning period. In the drilling period, the bit cuts the rock formation and generates the cuttings. As the drilling progresses, the cuttings are transported toward to the surface. Depending on the flow rate and the well deviation angle, cuttings usually form a cuttings bed in the highly deviated section of a wellbore (between 60o and 90o) and form sand dunes between 40o and 60o of the build section. In the vertical wellbore (between 0o and 40o), the particles are usually fully fluidized. Once the drilling is completed, all cuttings should be cleaned out of the hole. The cuttings could be removed out of the hole when the bit remains at the last position (called the stationary circulation hole cleaning mode) or pull the drilling string out of the hole, at the same time the fluid continues to be circulated (called the wiper trip hole cleaning mode). For conventional drilling, the stationary circulation mode is usually applied during the hole-cleaning period since the pump rate is relatively high (annular fluid velocity $>$1 m/s) and the drill pipe can also be rotated to aid the solids transport.},

  abstract = {In this study, 600 tests were conducted and a new computer program was developed for the prediction of cuttings transport in the multiphase system(gas+liquid+cuttings). The sensitivity of cuttings bed height with respect to liquid/gas volume flow rate ratio, in-situ liquid velocity, rate of penetration(ROP), inclination angle, and circulation fluid properties was conducted. The hole-cleaning time with both circulation mode and wiper trip is also discussed. The results from the sensitivity analysis presented in this paper indicate, first, that the fraction of the circulation liquid has a significant impact on the cuttings transport in underbalanced drilling with gasified fluids;second, that among different variables, the in-situ liquid velocity is the most important variable for cuttings transport; and, finally, the hole-cleaning time decreases nonlinearly with increasing fluid circulation rate.IntroductionCuttings transport has a major impact on the economics of the drilling process. Problems that may be caused by poor hole cleaning include stuck pipe, reduced weight on bit leading to reduced ROP, transient hole blockage leading to lost circulation conditions, excessive drill pipe wear, extra cost for special mud additives, and wasted time by wiper-trip maneuvers.Sand production is a common problem faced by many of the oil producers, especially in the heavy oil industry. Several cleanout options have been developed over the years, employing a number of different technical approaches. One of most common options is running in with coiled tubing and circulating the sand out with a liquid or gasified liquid. An important consideration in designing cleanout operations is the proper selection of the pump rate and circulation fluid. These parameters should be optimized in order to transport the sand to surface with the least cost. High circulation rates can cause higher costs and other operational problems.Over the past two decades, considerable effort has been expended into the research of cuttings transport in deviated wells with a single-phase flow. A large number of experiments have been conducted to study the effects of various parameters on cuttings-bed formation. A brief literature review was given by TUDRP.1-2 Experimental research on cuttings transport in inclined wells has been conducted using flow loops at the U. of Tulsa,3-6 the U. of Heriot-Watt,7 Mobil R\&D Corp., M-I Drilling Fluid Co., BP Research Center, Inst. Francais du Petrole, and Petrobras.8-12Several hole-cleaning correlations/models have been developed.4-6,13 Larsen,4 Jalukar,5 and Bassal6 conducted a total of 2,076 tests using the TUDRP's 5-in. and 8-in. flow loops. Based on the test results, they developed correlations to predict the critical velocity and cuttings-bed height. The correlations provide a means of analyzing cuttings transport as a function of operating conditions (flow rate, penetration rate, and rotation speed), mud properties (density, rheology), well configuration(angle, hole size, and pipe size), and cuttings size. Adari et. al.13 developed empirical models to correlate the cuttings-bed height and the hole-cleaning time to drilling fluid properties and flow rate for the wellbore near the horizontal position.Similar to the models developed in the mining industry,14-16 layer mechanistic models to predict the bed height and pressure drop. However, such models are not able to model cuttings transport at medium inclination angles (35-55°) due to the chaotic motion of the cuttings.1 Furthermore, there are various unknown parameters, such as friction coefficients and a turbulent diffusion coefficient, involved in the models. These coefficients have to be determined based on comprehensive test results. There is still a gap between the model development and field application.21Most of the previous cuttings transport studies in the drilling industry mainly focused on finding the minimum critical velocity and bed height or total cuttings concentration in the wellbore annulus for conventional rotary drilling with mud fluids. Recently, Rodriguez22conducted solids-transport tests with gasified fluids in near-horizontal wellbores. Based on the concept of critical velocity, he developed correlations to predict the minimum air and water flow rates required in order to avoid the formation of a stationary solids bed. However, this concept still lacks information related to cuttings transport with two-phase fluids and the prediction of the hole-cleaning time. In fact, there are different transport mechanisms during the bed erosion (ROP=0) process and during cuttings transport while drilling (ROP$>$0).21In this study, a comprehensive experimental test of cuttings transport with two-phase fluids was conducted. The effect of liquid/gas volume flow rate ratio, in-situ liquid velocity, ROP, inclination angle, and circulation fluid properties on cuttings transport was investigated. However, this paper's main focus is on angles close to horizontal. Based on the test results, a computer program was developed and the sensitivity analysis of cuttings transport parameters, such as cuttings-bed height and hole-cleaning time, was conducted.Experimental SetupThe test apparatus (Fig. 1) was designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements.Annular-flow steady-state conditions must prevail in every test case.The apparatus must allow the selection of the most important drilling variables (gas and liquid flow rates, well inclination, annular geometry configuration, cuttings concentration, and drill pipe size/eccentricity, etc.).The flow loop, shown in Fig. 1, was used throughout this project. The loop consists of a 20-ft transparent Lexan pipe with a 5-in. inner diameter simulating the openhole and a 2 3/8-in. steel inner pipe to simulate a drillpipe. The inner pipe is positioned on the bottom of Lexan pipe to simulate the worst case for the cuttings transport (eccentricity=100\%).},

  abstract = {A new physically based model is described in this paper which has been developed based on the analysis of forces acting on the Cuttings and the associated dimensionless groups. The model can be used to predict the critical (minimum) flow rate (CFR) required to remove, or prevent the formation of, stationary cuttings beds on the low-side of the wellbore in deviated wells. The model has been validated with the experimental data obtained from an 8" wellbore simulator located at BP Research Centre Sunbury, and with field data from 8-1/2", 12-1/4" and 17-1/2" holes.

By using the model, the effects of major drilling variables on cuttings transport are evaluated and compared with experimental and actual field data. The results show that the model accurately predicts the effects of the major variables such as: hole angle, penetration rate, mud properties and flow regime. In particular, the model provides a mechanism to support the use of both low and high viscosity pills, and mud low-shear enhancers - which have been widely used during drilling operations to improve hole cleaning.

The model has been incorporated into a Computer program which can predict the GFR under the specified drilling conditions. A series of simplified hole cleaning charts have also been developed which enable the optimum hole cleaning parameters to be determined at the rig-site.},

  abstract = {The rheological model of Herschel and Bulkley reported in 1926 can be applied to determine the characteristic parameters of a drilling fluid. In this paper, an in-situ characterization approach is proposed. During flow tests at fixed drilling depths inside the well the pump rates and the relative stand pipe pressures (SPPs) are recorded. This allows one to determine in-situ the Herschel and Bulkley rheological parameters and the behavior of the drilling mud circulating in the well. The results are compared to those obtained in the laboratory using a Fann VG 35 viscometer for the same drilling mud. It is found that the rheological triad from the viscometer data does not always coincide with the rheological triad from the in-situ drilling test. Thus, the calculated SPP using viscometer readings could lead to misleading errors for an actual process. This method could be useful not only to calculate and predict the SPP, but also to evaluate with accuracy the annular pressure drop in order to obtain the maximum allowable pump rates without fracturing the formations. We discuss the sensitivity of the results in relation to the equivalent viscosity of the drilling fluids considered to some of the main practical drilling parameters, such as the flow velocity and pressure spatial distribution along the wellbore profile and, with reference to the mud structure, sensitivity to pressure and temperature. Considering the drilling well essentially as a viscometer (WAV) enables one to investigate the performance of the drilling hydraulic circuit and also the effects of the true effective viscosity (here called equivalent viscosity) and of the rheological behavior of the muds in all types of wells, and overall in deep wells with great accuracy.},

  abstract = {In drilling horizontal wells and extended reach wells effective transport of drill cuttings is critical. Cuttings deposition and accumulation could lead to formation of deposit bed(s) inside the annulus, causing stuck drillpipe, eccentric borehole, poor penetration rate, etc. Experimental investigations reported in the literature previously focused on evaluation of cuttings transport performance in directional wells, as functions of mud flow rate, mud rheology, angle of inclination, pipe rotation, flow regime, etc. Empirical correlations were also developed for critical flow rate for different flow conditions.In this study, both experimental investigation and numerical simulation were performed to determine the critical cuttings transport velocity in inclined annulus, for different flow conditions. Experiments were carried out in a flow-loop, using a novel data-acquisition-and-analysis system. The behavior of drill cuttings at both steady-state and unsteady-state flow conditions were recorded by a CCD video camera system. The captured images were then analyzed to obtain the velocity profile, the cross-sectional distribution, and average velocity of cuttings in annulus. Results from this experimental investigation were compared against those predicted by an unsteady-state cuttings transport numerical model developed in-house. The numerical model developed for the study allows for the interaction between the drill cuttings and drilling fluid, and follows broadly the two-layer model reported in the literature. It enabled the determination of pressure, fluid and cuttings velocity, fluid and cuttings concentration distributions inside the annulus at different times. The model was run using parameters similar to experimental conditions. Its results agree closely with experimental data for the critical flow rate for cuttings transport in inclined borehole, for the majority of cases. Introduction Effective cuttings transport is critical in drilling productive horizontal and extended reach wells. In these cases, failure to remove drill cuttings from the hole would lead to deposition and accumulation of cuttings in the annulus, resulting in stuck pipe, eccentric annulus and/or reduced penetration rate. As a result, cuttings transport has continued to be a subject of interest to engineers and researchers. There have been a number of experimental investigations on different aspects of cuttings transport; recently, several studies have also been performed on numerical modelling of cuttings transport. In this study we follow a multi-faceted approach, with one of our main objectives being to use experimental data to validate the mechanistic numerical model.Experimental InvestigationSome of the earliest experimental studies of cuttings transport in directional drilling were carried out by University of Tulsa researchers. Tomren, Iyoho and Azar [1] studied effects of pipe rotation and eccentricity, hole inclination angle, type of drilling mud, flow regimes on cuttings transport performance. They found that hole inclination angle of 40°-50° was critical due to cuttings buildup and downward sliding of cuttings bed. Pipe rotation had a small effect on cuttings transport performance, in contrast with pipe eccentricity which was found to have a significant impact on cuttings removal. Okrajni and Azar [2] studied experimentally the effects of field-measured mud rheological properties (e.g. YPIPV ratio) on cuttings transport in directional well drilling. Higher mud yield value reduced annular cuttings concentration, particularly in laminar flow regime. Effect of mud yield was insignificant in high-angle wells ($>$55°). Becker, Azar and Okrajni [3] correlated rheological properties, including mud yield point, plastic viscosity, power-law exponent, consistency index, etc., with cuttings transport performance from 180 tests. They indicated that data with low-shear-rate parameters correlated better with annular cuttings concentration in steady-state flow. Hagar, Tian and Adewumi [4] conducted a series of laboratory experiments to examine mechanisms involved in solids transport in deviated wells. Sanchez et al. [5] investigated effect of drill pipe rotation on hole cleaning in directional well drilling. The results showed drill pipe rotation to have a significant effect on hole cleaning, and the dynamic behavior of the drill pipe (vibration, whirling, etc.) play a major role on improvement of hole cleaning. Ford et al. [6] conducted an experimental investigation of drilled cuttings transport in inclined boreholes.Experimental InvestigationSome of the earliest experimental studies of cuttings transport in directional drilling were carried out by University of Tulsa researchers.

  abstract = {The well trajectories becoming more and more complex (Extended Reach Drilling, Horizontal or Multilateral Drilling, Ultra-Deep Drilling, 3D wells….), the associated drillstring composition being unconventional and the material being used to its operating limit, the necessity to have a tool that predicts realistically forces, bending moment and contact loads along the wellbore is essential. To simulate the mechanical behavior of the drillstring, the industry generally uses a stiff-string model for the bottom bole assembly (BHA) to predict drilling trajectories, and a soft-string model for the entire drillstring to calculate torque and drag.~ The conventional soft-string model gives a good approximation of forces and contact loads in the drillstring for very smooth well trajectories, but is inappropriate when the trajectory becomes tortuous (micro or macro-tortuosity) or complex, as the drillstring no longer contacts the low side of the borehole. An advanced numerical method has been applied to address the 3D mechanical problem of a complete drillstring moving and freely rotating inside a wellbore : computation of the unknown contacts between the drillstring and the wellbore. As this new model does not use the time consuming finite element analysis, it can be used in real-time drilling operation at the rig to monitor torque and drag. For the first time, it is even possible to perform simultaneously a torque and drag, buckling and directional analysis while drilling. The power of a 3D visualization of the drillstring deformed inside the wellbore enables to localize easily contact loads on any drillstring component, from the drilling bit (including side force at the bit and tilt) to the top drive or rotary table (hook load and rotary torque at surface), facilitating drilling problems analysis. This paper will describe the fundamentals of the model developed and shows the differences between the conventional soft-string model and the advanced stiff-string model in terms of tension, torque and contact points between the drillstring and the wellbore, for many actual wells. With the help of the 3D visualization software, this paper will show the cases where the drill pipe contacts the high side of the borehole, or goes up to the right or the left side of the borehole depending on the right or left turn rate of the well trajectory. This new model should improve significantly the torque-drag and buckling calculations and the understanding of the~drillstring contributions to overall drilling performance. Introduction Drillstring mechanics is essential for many drilling matters : well planning, drillstring design, completion, directional analysis, torque and drag, buckling and drilling bit performance (stability, drillability and steerability).~Without an accurate assesment of the forces and stresses all along the drillstring, from the bit to the top-drive, the operator may risk serious well damage. Many mathematical models have been developped in the past to estimate the mechanical behavior of tubulars inside wellbore for many purposes. These models are either static or dynamic, 2D or 3D dimensional, and are~sometimes analytical or use numerical methods. Today, the models generally use finite element analysis for BHA modeling to predict the directional behaviour of the drilling assembly, and use analytical models or finite element analysis for the whole drillstring to compute torque and drag. This paper focuses on a model based on a new numerical method to address the 3D static mechanical behavior of a complete drillstring moving and freely rotating inside a wellbore : from the bit to the top-drive.},

  abstract = {The Advanced Cuttings Transport Study (ACTS) was a 5-year JIP project undertaken at the University of Tulsa (TU). The project was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and JIP member companies. The objectives of the project were: i) to develop and construct a new research facility that would allow three-phase (gas, liquid and cuttings) flow experiments under ambient and EPET (elevated pressure and temperature) conditions, and at different angle of inclinations and drill pipe rotation speeds; ii) to conduct experiments and develop a data base for the industry and academia; and iii) to develop mechanistic models for optimization of drilling hydraulics and cuttings transport. This project consisted of research studies, flow loop construction and instrumentation development.
Following a one-year period for basic flow loop construction, a proposal was submitted by TU to the DOE for a five-year project that was organized in such a manner as to provide a logical progression of research experiments as well as additions to the basic flow loop. The flow loop additions and improvements included: i) elevated temperature capability; ii) two-phase (gas and liquid, foam etc.) capability; iii) cuttings injection and removal system; iv) drill pipe rotation system; and v) drilling section elevation system.
In parallel with the flow loop construction, hydraulics and cuttings transport studies were preformed using drilling foams and aerated muds. In addition, hydraulics and rheology of synthetic drilling fluids were investigated. The studies were performed under ambient and EPET conditions. The effects of temperature and pressure on the hydraulics and cuttings transport were investigated. Mechanistic models were developed to predict frictional pressure loss and cuttings transport in horizontal and near-horizontal configurations. Model predictions were compared with the measured data. Predominately, model predictions show satisfactory agreements with the measured data.
As a part of this project, instrumentation was developed to monitor cuttings beds and characterize foams in the flow loop. An ultrasonic-based monitoring system was developed to measure cuttings bed thickness in the flow loop. Data acquisition software controls the system and processes the data.
Two foam generating devices were designed and developed to produce foams with specified quality and texture. The devices are equipped with a bubble recognition system and an in-line viscometer to measure bubble size distribution and foam rheology, respectively.
The 5-year project is completed. Future research activities will be under the umbrella of Tulsa University Drilling Research Projects. Currently the flow loop is being used for testing cuttings transport capacity of aqueous and polymer-based foams under elevated pressure and temperature conditions. Subsequently, the effect of viscous sweeps on cuttings transport under elevated pressure and temperature conditions will be investigated using the flow loop. Other projects will follow now that the “steady state” phase of the project has been achieved.},

  abstract = {Based on our previously developed prototype simulator, a transient cuttings transport simulator using the two-layer model was developed with some modifications and improvements for more practical use. To evaluate functionality and potential of the simulator, a post analysis on hole cleaning were carried out for an actual extend reach well (ERW) drilled in Japan. Simulation results showed that the modified model successfully demonstrated transient distributions of cuttings bed height and annular pressure over the whole trajectory of the well. From the comparison with a conventional steady-state analysis, transient simulation over the whole trajectory was found to be crucial and useful for prediction of behaviors unrecognized by steady-state simulations. Introduction Hole cleaning or effective cuttings transport is one of the biggest challenges in drilling ERWs. Many efforts have been made by researchers to reveal cuttings transport mechanism in their previous works.1,2 Several modeling and simulation methods have been proposed as well as comprehensive experimental studies. There are few simulation tools, however, which satisfy the industry requirement to use for more practical and comprehensive study on hole cleaning. One of the problems might lie in the situation that most conventional cuttings transport models or numerical simulators are of steady-state calculations. Consequently, most of them are for use of obtaining critical flow rate for a single section of the whole well with a constant hole geometry at a time. In this study, based on our previously developed prototype simulator,3 a transient cuttings transport simulator was developed with some modifications and improvements for more practical use in field operating conditions. To evaluate functionality and potential of the simulator, a post analysis on hole cleaning were carried out for an actual ERW drilled in Japan. Also a comparison with conventional steady-state analysis is presented in this paper. Mathematical Model and Its Modifications The mathematical model uses the two-layer model which describes an isothermal transient 1D flow of solid-liquid two phases in well annulus (Figs. 1 and 2). The basic equations comprise mass and momentum conservation, which are summarized in Appendix A. Required constitutive equations to solve the basic equations are detailed in Appendix B. Although the model has been originally developed for use of underbalanced drilling with gasified drilling fluids, for simplification of explanation, descriptions in this paper accounts only for a single-phase liquid drilling fluid. The rheology model of drilling fluid is assumed to be power-law. Modifications described below were made for more practical simulation by use of field data. Modification of Cuttings Entrainment Transfer Rate Formulation. Mass and momentum transfer between layers play a significant role in transient fluid flow modeling. In the previous work,3 however, the slope ment and the critical friction velocity u*12 in cuttings entrainment rate formulation, Eq. B-19, were said to be tuning parameters to match simulation results with experimental data for cuttings concentration. From our experimental observations and parameter sensitivity analysis, an implication that the cuttings entrainment rate should be a function of hole inclination angle, was obtained. Keeping the simple linear form of the entrainment rate equation, the critical friction velocity u*12 in Eq. B-19 was reformulated based on the mechanistic model proposed by Clark and Bickham.4 As shown in Fig. 3, gravity force Fg, drag force FD and lift force FL act on a single spherical cuttings particle just about to move at the surface of deposited bed. These forces can be written in terms of the friction velocity u12, as follows. Equation ~(1)},

  abstract = {Cuttings transport in aerated mud drilling for inclined annuli with inclination angles between 30° to horizontal was investigated. Experiments were carried out for over 300 flow conditions using a 9-m long un-pressurized annular test section with 5-in. CSG and 2-in. DP, concentric or eccentric annulus geometry. Two types of base liquids, water and PHPA solution, were used for aerated muds. In the experiments, cuttings were fed into the test section at a constant rate corresponding to a supposed ROP, and the volumetric concentration of cuttings in the annulus under steady state was measured. From the analysis on the variation of cuttings concentration with mud flow rates ranging from sub-critical to critical regions, the critical flow rate (CFR) criterion avoiding a formation of cuttings bed was found to correspond to the cuttings concentration of about 4 vol\%. The annular velocity (AV) equivalent to the CFR was as high as 2 m/s in highly inclined eccentric annulus using non-Newtonian conventional PHPA fluid. Air injection significantly reduced the CFR and improved the cuttings transport efficiency in highly inclined annulus except for the horizontal annulus in which much higher AV of about 1.5 m/s was still required to transport cuttings effectively. The result indicates that the flow pattern between gas and liquid considerably affects the cuttings transport performance. Introduction},

  abstract = {Hole cleaning during directional well drilling is a major concern in the oil patch and must be monitored and properly controlled during the entire drilling operation. Inadequate drilled cuttings removal can cause many costly problems such as mechanical pipe sticking, excessive torque and drag, difficulties in casing/cementing and in logging. Low fluid annular velocity, lack of drill pipe rotation and the wrong mud properties are primary factors in the inadequacy of effective hole cleaning. This paper presents a thorough review on previous hole cleaning studies and discusses an approach that uses physical- systematic methodology that is more suited for monitoring and controlling hole cleaning problems. The approach is based on relating output and internal state vectors to input vectors. The concept basis is to classify the drilling parameters into inputs, internal states and outputs, check the observability (condition monitoring) and controllability of the hole cleaning as an internal state during drilling. Previous studies on drilled cutting transport can be grouped in four categories: Sensitivity analysis –internal states changes vs. input changes Modeling – physical relations of inputs and internal state Monitoring – using real time measured data to estimate the internal state Control – change inputs until achieving the desired internal state},

  abstract = {Drilling fluid sweeps are commonly run in the field to help clean the borehole of cuttings that have not been removed with normal drilling fluid circulation, especially in high angle or extended reach wells where efficient hole cleaning is more difficult to maintain. This study focuses on the use of "conventional" and "enhanced" sweeps in horizontal well bores. Not much information pertaining to the use of drilling fluid sweeps is available in the literature. Furthermore, there has been a lack of agreement as to which types of sweep fluids are most effective. Conventional sweeps most often include high viscosity fluids, high density fluids or a combination of both. In addition to conventional sweep fluids, an attempt was made to use enhanced sweep fluids, in which surfactants are used to attach cuttings to oil droplets that are intentionally introduced to the drilling fluid system. Because of their low density, oil droplets can have the ability to keep cuttings particles in suspension. The use of oil droplets is a new concept in cleaning horizontal and deviated wellbores. This work focuses on experimental analysis of sweep fluids with the goal of quantifying the sweep "efficiency". A small-scale sweep loop (SSL) was mainly used to conduct sweep experiments. Moreover, some experiments were carried out in a field-scale flow loop that operates at low-pressure ambient temperature (LPAT) conditions. Results show that pipe rotation plays a very important role in improving hole cleaning. Particularly, the improvement is substantial with high-viscosity fluids. The rotation of pipe has agitation effect that forces the cuttings particles into the main flow and facilitates the removal process. As anticipated, increasing the flow rate enhances the sweep efficiency or cuttings removal regardless of the drillpipe rotation. Furthermore, the study suggests that with a more rigorous evaluation of sweep efficiency, one can objectively determine the type and frequency of drilling sweep. The results of this study are useful for selection of the optimal sweep fluid.},

  abstract = {The studies conducted on hole cleaning have been started with single phase drilling fluids for vertical holes in 1930’s, and have reached to multiphase drilling fluids for directional and horizontal wells today. The influence of flow rate and hole inclination on cuttings transport has been well understood, and many studies have been conducted on effective hole cleaning either experimentally or theoretically. However, neither the hydraulic behavior nor the hole cleaning mechanism of gasified drilling fluids has been properly understood. The aims of this study are to investigate and analyze the hole cleaning performance of gasified drilling fluids in horizontal, directional and vertical wells experimentally, to identify the drilling parameters those have the major influence on cuttings transport, to define the flow pattern types and boundaries as well as to observe the behavior of cuttings in detail by using digital image processing techniques, and to develop a mechanistic model based on the fundamental principles of physics and mathematics with the help of the experimental observations. A mechanistic model is developed with the help of the obtained experimental data. Developed model is used for estimating optimum flow rates for liquid and gas phases for effective cuttings transport as well as for determining the total pressure losses and void fraction of each phase for a given drilling conditions. The mechanistic model obtained using the experimental data within the scope of this study will be used to develop the hydraulic program and equipment selection to be used in the field during underbalanced drilling applications.},

  abstract = {A general dynamic model for any flow-related operation during well construction and interventions has been developed. The model is a basis for a new generation support tools and technologies needed in today's environment with advanced well designs, challenging drilling conditions and need for fast and reliable real-time decision support. The solution method uses a "divide and conquer?? scheme, which computes the flow in each well segment separately, and then solves for the appropriate flow in the junctions. This simplifies greatly simulating complex flow networks, such as multilateral wells and jet subs. The flexibility allows incorporating additional pumps in the flow loop, as in Dual Gradient Systems. The model includes dynamic 2-D temperature calculations, covering the radial area affecting the well and assuming radial symmetry in the vicinity of the well. Other features: ~~~~Flexible boundary conditions (which includes drilling, tripping) ~~~~Non-Newtonian frictional pressure loss ~~~~Transient well-reservoir interaction ~~~~Slip between phases ~~~~Advanced PVT relationship The reason for this new approach was to respond constructively to today's challenges (complex and difficult drilling conditions, need for reliable real time decision support). Our approach has been more flexibility, improved accuracy, reduced numerical diffusion and increased computational speed. The paper will present the basic model assumptions; the model architecture, and solution methods. Integration of the model into a real time system with links to real time databases and advanced visualization tools is currently ongoing. Thus the model may follow the whole work process through planning, training, execution, and post analysis. Examples of applications of the model so far will be presented, as well as visions for future applications. Introduction Alongside the advances in instrumentation and the more intelligent tools being developed today, there is a need for advanced numerical simulators that can bring all the technologies together to do intelligent drilling that will increase safety, reduce the costs, and make previously "impossible?? fields "possible??. The challenge in making the simulators lies in making the simulator kernel able to include all the important physical parameters; the important events; compute correct results; and fast enough to meet real time requirements. Examples of some of the recent improvements of the "events?? that simulators are able to dynamically simulate are: control during underground blowout1; and hydrate formation2. In order to do this, the kernel needs to be able to change boundary conditions and connectivity during a single simulation. The simulator kernel presented here fulfills the needs of the present and many of the future challenges, as shown in the examples. The next chapters briefly explain the models used in the simulator, and the numerical methods used. The flexibility of the simulator is illustrated through a few examples, and the results of its use in real situation are presented.},

  abstract = {The three-layer model concept developed previously for solid–liquid flow has been adapted to model solids transport in inclined channels. The present model predicts the pressure loss and transport rate of solids in Newtonian and power-law fluid suspensions by assuming stratified flow conditions. Sets of stationary sand bed transport rate tests were performed to verify the predictions of the model. A 70-mm flow loop was constructed to measure the average transport rates and critical flow rates, which are required to initiate the motion of solids bed particles. The tests were carried out by eroding stationary sand beds with water and an aqueous solution of poly anionic cellulose (PAC) in a transparent pipe. Four sand beds with different particle size ranges were used. The average transport rates of the beds were predicted using the model. The model predictions show a satisfactory agreement with experimentally measured results when the grain Reynolds number is between 15 and 400 and the flow rate is sufficiently higher than the critical flow rate. Therefore, with some degree of limitation, the three-layer model can be applicable for predicting the transport rates of stationary solids beds in inclined channels for both Newtonian and power-law fluids},

  abstract = {Beds of cuttings are usually formed on the bottom of large, high-angle wellbores during drilling. When the drill string is moved axially along the wellbore, large bottom-hole assembly elements such as drill bit and stabilizers tend to plow the cuttings bed, thereby causing the formation of plugs of cuttings which give rise to high overpulls, loss of circulation, continuous need for operations such as backreaming, and stuck pipe. To reduce the likelihood of these costly hole problems occurring, it is necessary to minimize the height of the cuttings bed which forms while drilling, and to minimize the tendency of the bottom-hole assembly to form plugs of cuttings. This can be done with a new hole cleaning tool described in this paper. This tool was developed using a combination of analytical modeling based on fluid mechanics first principles, experimental data, and field data. The tool enables establishment of pump flow rates, drilling fluid rheological properties, drill string configurations, and well profiles for minimal risk of experiencing problems associated with the existence of a cuttings bed.},

  abstract = {Experience has shown that discharges of drill cuttings and mud from a platf01m have
sinking velocities considerably above what is expected from the sinking velocities of
the individual cuttings and barite (weighting material) particles. The reason for this is
pa1t ly due to formation of larger pa1ticles when the discharge mud has "sticky"
prope1ties (for SBM and OBM), and pa1tly because a near-field plume is f01med with
a density larger than the ambient water.
When WBM is used, the downward motiom of the pa1ticles may still be enhanced due
to the downward motion of the near-field plume. However, the f01mation of larger
pa1t icles may not be evident in this case because the "sticky" prope1ties of the mud
are absent. It is sometimes argued that "flocculation processes" may still f01m larger
pa1t icles which will enhance the sinking velocities of the pa1ticles also for the WBM
case.
The presence or absence of these "flocculation processes" are imp01tant for the
calculation of the deposition, because larger sinking velocities will tend to concentrate
the debris closer to the drilling site, compared to calculations that does not include the
effects from flocculation processes.
The paper explains the eff01ts unde1taken to examine the presence of "flocculation
processes" for discharges of WBM. These effo1ts include a comparisons between
measured and model simulated depositions ofbarite on the sea floor when WBM is
used, an extrapolation of results from laborat01y experiments to examine the expected
imp01tance of the flocculation processes, a re-examination of field data collected on

  volume = {4},
  doi = {10.2118/56406-PA},
  shorttitle = {{{SPE}}-56406-{{PA}}},
  abstract = {The effect of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning during directional-well drilling is investigated. An 8 in. diameter wellbore simulator, 100 ft long, with a 4½ in. drillpipe was used for the study. The variables considered in this experimental work are: rotary speed, hole inclination, mud rheology, cuttings size, and mud flow rate. Over 600 tests were conducted.The rotary speed was varied from 0 to 175 rpm. High viscosity and low viscosity bentonite muds and polymer muds were used with ¼ in. crushed limestone and 1/10 in. river gravel cuttings. Four hole inclinations were considered: 40°, 65°, 80°, and 90° from vertical.The results show that drillpipe rotation has a significant effect on hole cleaning during directional-well drilling, contrary to what has been published by previous researchers who forced the drillpipe to rotate about its own axis. The level of enhancement due to pipe rotation is a function of the simultaneous combination of mud rheology, cuttings size, and mud flow rate. Also it was observed that the dynamic behavior of the drillpipe (steady state vibration, unsteady sate vibration, whirling rotation, true axial rotation parallel to hole axis, etc.) plays a major role on the significance in the improvement of hole cleaning.Generally, smaller cuttings are more difficult to transport. However, at high rotary speed and with high viscosity muds, the smaller cuttings seem to become easier to transport. Generally, in inclined wells, low viscosity muds clean better than high viscosity muds, depending on cuttings size, viscosity, and rotary speed level.IntroductionNumerous studies on cuttings transport have been conducted for the past two decades. Although several investigators have made observations on the effect of drillpipe rotation, most have focused their studies on mud rheology and annular velocities. This is the first time an extensive experimental study is conducted with the sole purpose of investigating the effect of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning.In the past, the effect of drillpipe rotation was thought to be minimal. This belief was based on the results of experiments which were conducted in flow loops that used centralizers to constrain the pipe to rotate on its own axis, avoiding any orbital motion. Although the motion of the pipe will change at different positions along the well, it is now believed that in most cases the drillstring will have both rotary and orbital motion, even when in tension. In this case, it is the orbital motion and not the rotation that improves hole cleaning. When the pipe is rotating only along its axis, it will cause a shift and a slight increase in the velocity profile in the annular area, causing the velocities on one side of the hole to be higher than on the other. Generally, a no slip condition at the boundaries in the annulus is assumed. These include the boundary between the hole or casing and the fluid, the boundary between the fluid and the drillpipe, and the boundary between the fluid and the cuttings bed. If the pipe is not rotating, the velocity of the fluid particles at these boundaries is zero. When the pipe rotates, this boundary condition means that the velocity of the fluid particles adjacent to drillpipe is equal to the rotational speed of the pipe, perpendicular to the hole axis, resulting in a pseudo-helical flow. The minor effects observed in tests conducted under this configuration (using centralizers) indicate that the shift and the increase of the annular velocities are minor and do not affect cuttings transport significantly. On the other hand, the orbital motion of the pipe improves the transport of cuttings significantly in two ways: First, the mechanical agitation of the cuttings in an inclined hole sweeps the cuttings resting on the lower side of the hole into the upper side, where the annular velocity is higher. Second, the orbital motion exposes the cuttings under the drillstring cyclically to the moving fluid particles. Even though investigators have been aware of this phenomenon, it has usually been ignored for several reasons: First, the orbital motion of the string will generally reduce the cuttings concentration in the annulus, and therefore ignoring it was thought to be a conservative approach. Second, the dynamics of the drillstring in the wellbore is still not well understood. Also, the borehole simulators currently available that allow simulation of pipe rotation assume that the pipe does not orbitate. However, the reduction in cuttings concentration and improvement on bed erosion are too high to be ignored. Furthermore, recent advances in drillstring dynamics could eventually evolve into a complex cuttings transport simulator that accounts for orbital motion.As will be shown, the benefit of pipe rotation to hole cleaning is a function mainly of rotary speed, hole inclination, and flow rate, mud rheology, and cuttings size. The latter two have the least effect.ExperimentsOver 600 tests were conducted at The University of Tulsa (TUDRP) cuttings transport facility. A full scale 8 in.×100 ft wellbore simulator (Fig. 1) with 4½ in. drillpipe was used. A data acquisition system records information every second. The information recorded allows monitoring of cuttings concentration (mass in the test section) throughout the duration of each test. A detailed description of the facility is given in Refs. 2 and 3.Test Procedure.The test procedure was designed to study the effect of pipe rotation on:Cuttings concentration while drilling (at steady state conditions),Bed erosion after drilling has stopped,Cuttings transport patterns.},

  abstract = {The study of stratified solid liquid annular flows is of great interest of the petroleum engineering, specifically in the drilling area. This kind of flow describes the phenomena involved in the transport of the solids generated by the bit during the drilling of a horizontal or highly inclined well. In these operations there is tendency. due to the action of gravitational forces, of solids deposition in the lower part of the annular region formed by the wellbore walls and the drill column. One approach is the well known Two Layer Model, originally proposed by the mining industry to simulate the transport of solids at high concentrations in pipes. This model has been adapted to the problem of drilled cuttings transport, by the introduction of elements to model the non Newtonian behavior of the fluid and the annular geometry and is currently in use for design and troubleshooting in drilling operations. Some limitations of the model in the reprodttction of the role of rheology in the transport of solids motivated the formulation of more precise hypothesis. This paper deals with the analysis of the effect of the improvements in the final results of the model. Such improvements include the experimental determination of interfacial friction between the solids bed and the suspension. new criteria for solid liquid slip conditions and the choice of different rheological models.},

  abstract = {The absence of the basic data needed to fully evaluate present field practices and current concepts on drill cutting transport prompted this full scale study. Several drill pipe and casing sizes were used in a l40-ft vertical flow system to define the variables affecting drill cutting transport under steady state conditions. Variables evaluated were annular velocity (4 to 200 ft/min), fluid rheological properties (mud, water, oils) , cutting size (3-6 mesh), fluid weight (12-15 ppg) , rotary speed (0-200 rpm), drilling rate (cutting feed concentration), drill pipe position (centeredeccentric), and annular size. Annular velocity and fluid rheological properties were the most significant variables. Annular velocities well below the 120 ft/min used in most hydraulic programs were found adequate to clean the hole. Increasing apparent viscosity dramatically improved cutting transport. The other variables showed 2nd and 3rd order effects. Terminal slip velocities were a good indicator for the velocities required to initiate transport, but observed transport was 75 to 90\% of the theoretical values. These findings should destroy many myths on drill cutting transport and provide a factual basis for improving drilling hydraulics.},

  abstract = {This study aims to investigate hydraulics and the flow characteristics of drilling fluids inside annulus and to understand the mechanism of cuttings transport in horizontal and deviated wellbores. For this purpose, initially, extensive experimental studies have been conducted at Middle East Technical University, Petroleum \& Natural Gas Engineering Flow Loop using water and numerous drilling fluids for hole inclinations from horizontal to 60 degrees, flow velocities from 0.64 m/s to 3.05 m/s, rate of penetrations from 0.00127 to 0.0038 m/s, and pipe rotations from 0 to 120 rpm. Pressure loss within the test section and stationary and/or moving bed thickness are recorded. New friction factor charts and correlations as a function of Reynolds number and cuttings bed thickness with the presence of pipe rotation for water and drilling fluids in horizontal and deviated wellbores are developed by using experimental data. Meanwhile empirical correlations that can be used easily at the field are proposed for predicting stationary bed thickness and frictional pressure loss using dimensional analysis and the effect of the drilling parameters on hole cleaning is discussed. It has been observed that, the major variable influencing cuttings transport is fluid velocity. Moreover, pipe rotation drastically decreases the critical fluid velocity that is required to prevent the stationary cuttings bed development, especially if the pipe is making an orbital motion. A decrease in the pressure loss is observed due to the bed erosion while rotating the pipe. Cuttings transport in horizontal annulus is modeled using a CFD software for different fluid velocities, pipe rotation speeds and rate of penetrations. The CFD model is verified by using cuttings transport experiments. A mathematical model is also proposed to predict the flow characteristics of Newtonian fluids in concentric horizontal annulus with drillpipe rotation. The Navier-Stokes equations of turbulent flow are numerically solved using finite differences technique. A computer code is developed in Matlab 2007b for the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model is compared with the experimental data which were available in the literature and gathered at METUPETE Flow Loop as well as Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) software. The results showed that the mechanistic model accurately predicts the frictional pressure loss and the velocity profile inside the annuli. The model’s frictional pressure loss estimations are within an error range of ± 10\%.},

  abstract = {Cuttings transport is one of the most important aspects to control during drilling operations, but the effect of wellbore geometry on hole cleaning is not fully understood. This paper presents results from experimental laboratory tests where hydraulics and hole cleaning have been investigated for two different wellbore geometries; circular and a non-circular, where spiral grooves have been deliberately added to the wellbore wall in order to improve cuttings transport. Improving hole cleaning will improve drilling efficiency in general, and will in particular enable longer reach for ERD wells. The experiments have been conducted as part of a research project where friction and hydraulics in non-circular wellbores for more efficient drilling and well construction is the aim. The experiments have been performed under realistic conditions. The flow loop includes a 12 meter long test section with 2" diameter freely rotating drillstring inside a 4" diameter wellbore made of concrete. Sand particles were injected while circulating the drilling fluid through the test section in horizontal and 30° inclined positions. The test results show that borehole hydraulics and cuttings transport can be significantly improved in a non-circular wellbore relative to a circular wellbore. Investigating the cutting transport in non-circular wellbores with available models is even more complex than for circular wellbores. Most drilling models assume circular wellbores, but in reality the situation is often different. Also, it may be possible to create non-circular wellbores on purpose, as in the present study. Such a comparative, experimental study of hole cleaning in different wellbore geometries has to our knowledge previously never been performed, and the results were obtained in a custom-made and unique experimental flow loop. The results and the experimental approach could therefore be of value for any one working with drilling.},

However, the critical flow rate showed a maximum at certain ROP and then the critical flow rate decreases gradually with increasing ROP. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the effect of well inclination angle and cuttings diameter on the critical flow rate was significant.

Pipe rotation and eccentricity, as well as several types of drilling muds and flow regimes, were studied. Annulus angles varied from 0 to 90°, and actual drilled cuttings were used. The major factors affecting cuttings transport are drilling fluid velocity, hole inclination, and fluid rheological properties. Much higher annular velocities are required for effective hole cleaning in directional wells than in vertical wells. An increase in hole angle and/or drilling rate reduces the transport performance of drilling fluids. Hole angles of 40 to 50° are critical because of cuttings buildup and downward sliding of the bed of cuttings. High-viscosity muds were observed to provide better transport than low-viscosity muds.},

  abstract = {This study was conducted to gain a more in-depth understanding of solidstransport for coiled tubing workovers, cleanouts and drilling applications.Cuttings or particle transport in Coiled Tubing operations is a complex problemthat is affected by numerous parameters. Predicting effective cuttingstransport requires all of these parameters to be considered simultaneously.Tests were conducted to determine the effects of the followingparameters:
I) Different particle size,
II) Fluid rheology, including water, gel, and multi-phase fluids,
III) Pipe eccentricity, coiled tubing positioned on the low and high side ofthe wellbore.

The effects of the different parameters were investigated in two differentmodes: the circulation mode, that involves the development of a cuttings bed orbuild-up of cuttings in the wellbore, and hole cleaning mode, which is cleaningout an existing cuttings bed. It will be shown that the results indicate: 1)for the tested particle size range (0.150 - 7 mm), cleaning efficiency ispartly dependant upon the particle's size, 2) with suitable agitation, a gelledfluid is more effective for cuttings transport than water in a highly deviatedwellbore, 3) Pipe eccentricity has an effect on cuttings transport fordifferent fluids and 4) for complete wellbore clean-up it requires many morehole volumes than previous 'rules of thumb' would indicate.},

  abstract = {Abstract Hole cleaning is one of the key issues in extended reach drilling, the thickness of cutting bed monitor and control is the critical technique which urgent to solve. Based on solid-liquid flow mechanics, considering actions between the layers, slip between solid and liquid phase, and rotation of drill pipe, a three layer dynamic cutting transport model was developed, staggered mesh and Stability Enhancing Two Step method were adopted for the simulation. The influence factors of the thickness of cutting bed were analyzed, ECD with variable cutting bed can be accurately predicted, by compare the measured ECD with the theoretical value, the thickness of cutting bed can be monitored, and this technique has been successfully used in the oil field of South China Sea. The research results show that high angle hold segment is the most difficult segment for cutting transport. The pump can not reach the minimum flow rate for keeping the hole cleaning. Low viscosity drilling fluid, high flow rate and drill pipe rotation should be adopted, and when the thickness of cutting bed exceeds 10\%, flushing method must be used to remove the cuttings, the recommended flushing period is 150m. By this model, the dynamic process of cutting transport during drilling and flushing can be simulated. Giving a guideline to the design of hydraulic parameters, and offering an effective field method to monitor and control the hole cleaning in extended reach well. Introduction South China Sea is rich in oil and gas resources, it was known as "Second Persian Bay??. ERW (Extended Reach Well), as a cost-effective technology to develop offshore oil and gas fields, was more and more widely used in there. Because of high inclined angle, long distance and serious eccentricity, cuttings accumulate easily in the high angle and horizontal segment, that will cause wellbore instability, formed key slot, tool sticking, and et, al. Endless accidents happened because of the hole is not clean(ZHANG, et al, 2009; YONG, et al, 2002; PAYNE, et al, 1994). Cutting transport mechanics has been studied by many researchers(WANG, et al, 2009; SONG, et al, 2009; BILGESU, et al, 2007; WANG Z, et al, 2006; WANG and ZHANG, 2004; CHO, et al, 2000 ; NGUYEN and RAHMAN, 1996), and several steady models have been developed. Cutting transport in the steady state can be analyzed but the distribution of cuttings vary with time cannot be simulated by existing steady models, it will cause inaccurate prediction when the inclined angle is big and the horizontal segment is long. Moreover, because of the complexity of real process and the immature of solid-liquid fluid mechanics, the effect of drill pipe rotation was not considered in existing cutting transport models, however, drill pipe rotation is an important factor affecting the hole cleaning(WANG, et al, 2009; OZBAYOGLU, et al, 2008; SANCHEZ, et al, 1999 ; LOCKETT, et al, 1993), ignoring this factor will cause great discrepancies when compare with field data. Therefore, a new model for hole cleaning monitoring and control in ERW is proposed to predict and interpret the cutting transport mechanism . Based on the above analysis, considering the feature of ERW, a dynamic three layers cutting transport model was built. The thickness of cutting bed can be monitored by comparing the measured ECD with the theoretical value, some effective field methods were given to keep hole cleaning.},

  shorttitle = {{{SPE}}-13259-{{PA}}},
  abstract = {The penetration rate obtained with a roller cone bit is controlled by either the cuttings generation process or cuttings removal process. Most previously reported penetration rate models have not previously reported penetration rate models have not explicitly included the cuttings removal effects.This paper presents a penetration rate model that includes the effect of both the initial chip formation and cuttings removal processes. The model is an extension of a previously published model that neglected the effects of cuttings removal. The cuttings removal effects must be included in a valid penetration rate model because they can often penetration rate model because they can often the ROP to less than 20\% of the expected ROP for perfect cleaning. perfect cleaning. The model is used to show that the reduction in penetration rate at high borehole pressure is the penetration rate at high borehole pressure is the result of both local cratering effects and global cleaning effects. Increased hydraulics will increase the penetration rate when it is limited by global cleaning effects. The penetration rate reduction due to local cratering effects is largely a function of mud properties and borehole pressure and is not helped much by increases in hydraulics.IntroductionAlthough roller cone bits have been used for over 75 years, the complex mechanics and hydraulics involved with these bits has hindered the complete modeling of the drilling process. The combination of crushing and scraping of the teeth on a rolling cone makes it difficult to model the exact cratering process. The turbulent flow field of the mud under process. The turbulent flow field of the mud under the bit has not been completely modeled, so it is difficult to predict cuttings removal forces. The forces that hold cuttings to the formation can not be predicted very well because of the effects of mud properties on the equalization of the pressure properties on the equalization of the pressure around the chips. Consequently, most penetration rate models are based on empirical matching of experimental data.The complete drilling process is composed of a number of individual actions that must occur in order for the bit to penetrate. The complicated geometry of the bit makes measurement of the individual processes difficult, but test conditions can be designed to identify and model certain basic effects such as cuttings generation, cuttings removal, etc. By developing a model based on both theoretical concepts and experimental data taken under controlled conditions, the complex modeling problem can be reduced to a somewhat simpler one. problem can be reduced to a somewhat simpler one. After a basic model is developed, more complete conditions can be added to further define the model. If the physics of the process are handled property. the addition of the new conditions will not invalidate the previously determined model. The strategy described above was used to develop the model presented in this paper. The discussion of the model is intended mainly as a basis for presenting the effects of various parameters that control the rate of penetration (ROP). The model facilitates the comparison of the relative effects of changing various parameters that may be altered during drilling. It also aids in the evaluation of field bit performance to select conditions that may improve the ROP.},

  abstract = {Complex structural wells are widely used in the development of marine oilfield, old oilfield and low permeable oilfield. However, poor hole cleaning is often occurred in the highly-deviated sections and horizontal sections of the complex structural wells, which affects rate of penetration and downhole safety. The methods to study cuttings transport can be normally divided into four types: 1) experimental observations, 2) CFD simulations, 3) theoretical correlations and models and 4) field tests. Experimental observations and CFD simulations are mainly used to analyze the effects of different parameters on hole cleaning and obtain some valuable data. Theoretical models and correlations are mainly applied to calculate cuttings bed height, critical velocity and etc to provide the guidance for the design of hydraulic parameters. The accuracy of the first three types are checked by field tests. In this paper, the effects of flow rate, inclination, mud rheology, drillpipe rotation and other factors on hole cleaning, and some typical correlations and models were briefly reviewed before 2000 years, and some new research findings were detailedly addressed. In addition, CFD simulations also were introduced. Although major improvements have been achieved in the past several decades, building a comprehensive and proven model requires much more experimental researches, CFD simulations, in-depth theoretic studies and field tests due to the complexity of cuttings transport under multi-factor interactions.},

For this purpose, Eulerian multiphase flow model was used to simulate the influence of different blade types of stabilizers on cuttings transport efficiency under rotating coordinates. Numerical simulations indicate that straight blade stabilizer is obviously superior to helical blade for cuttings transport efficiency in vertical wells using the same hydraulic parameter and rotating speed. Field tests were conducted in some medium-deep wells of Daqing Oil Field, and the results showed that repeated fragmentation of cuttings, bit balling and pipe sticking problems were improved, and ROP was obviously raised.},

  abstract = {Transporting drilled cuttings from the bottomhole to the surface becomes more difficult and problematic in highly deviated wells than in vertical wells. Cuttings tend to settle down on the low side of the annulus typically in the form of a bed which can cause further problems. The height of this bed depends on many parameters such as annular domain geometry, drilling fluid density and rheology, annular flow rate, drill pipe rotation speed, cuttings size, shape, and their density. Prediction of the stationary cuttings bed height with respect to these aforementioned parameters is thus necessary to optimize the range of the controllable parameters for a desired level of wellbore cleaning. A computational setup that represents the spatial geometry of the cuttings transport domain, and utilizes discrete phase model coupled with numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations augmented by a turbulence closure model – SST version of k-omega is used for predicting the bed height of the stationary cuttings bed and moving cuttings velocities. Discrete phase model is a mathematical tool to navigate large number of particles in a flow field by calculating the particle paths in a Lagrangian frame by the time integration of force balance on each individual particle. Turbulence effects on the particle motion are also incorporated through a random walk model. The drag force on non-spherical particles is incorporated using a sphericity based correlation. Roughness of stationary bed surface is also incorporated through the modified law-of-the wall model. A snapshot technique is applied here in these simulations by computing flow solutions in the geometric domains with pre-defined stationary bed heights. The statistics of particle - wall collisions are analyzed over these geometrically pre-defined stationary bed surfaces to predict which domain would represent the equilibrium cuttings bed height. A systematic validation study is presented by comparing the simulation results against published experimental datasets for velocity profile estimation of non-Newtonian fluids flowing in turbulent regime, stationary bed heights, and moving bed velocities. Further, a parametric study is presented for the effects of wellbore inclination, fluid density and rheology, particle size and sphericity, inner pipe rotation and the inner pipe rotation speed.},

seeks to unify the wide range of industry personnel
concerned with hydraulics and rheology. The empirically
derived flow equation is expressed in a form easily
recognized by field engineers and is sufficiently accurate
for most high-end software applications. Attention also is

  abstract = {Cuttings transport has been a topic of research for many years. It has been observed that drilling fluids with similar properties according to the API standard can have significantly different behaviour with respect to the efficiency of cuttings transport. Oil based drilling fluids have been considered to be superior to water based drilling fluids when it comes to the hole cleaning, even if the fluid properties are equal as measured in accordance with API specifications. Despite this well-known fact, very limited studies are available in the literature to address this issue. Experimental studies with various oil-based drilling fluids and water-based drilling fluids were conducted in a 10m long flow loop under identical and controlled conditions. Further to understand the physics behind the observed differences in the cuttings transport efficiency, we have developed an Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model using commercial software ANSYS FLUENT. Experimental values from the flow loop experiments are compared with the CFD model results. CFD model helps to fill the gap in the results, which could not be obtained using experiments. The experimental results confirm that the annular frictional pressure loss in a fully eccentric annulus are significantly lesser than the values predicted by using models available in the literature for concentric annulus. CFD model includes realistic conditions like eccentric annulus and flow velocities. CFD model is used to conduct simulations for a wide range of parameters and the obtained results will be used to develop improved correlations for the prediction of cuttings transport.},

  doi = {10.1115/IMECE2016-67204},
  abstract = {Solids suspension has broad applications in the oil and gas industry (i.e., sand production, cuttings transportation during drilling, and barite sag in drilling fluids). The conventional modeling approaches for solids suspension and transportation include mechanics models (i.e., layer models) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based Eulerian-Lagrangian models. One of the most important assumptions for these approaches is that the solid particles have uniform size, which is not true in the actual applications. The computational fluid dynamics/discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approach can track each single particle in the system; however, the computational time is not practical for industrial applications.This paper presents a relatively simple Eulerian approach for characterizing solids suspension in multiphase flow systems. The multiphase flow equations are derived by using a proper averaging procedure without considering interphase mass transfer. A proposed new solids suspension model, which is based on the fluid-solid interaction and kinetic theory, account for multiple solids sizes in the flow. The suspension characterizations for particles with different sizes are considered by introducing a particle size distribution function, which also captures detailed particle distribution and fluid/particle and particle/particle interactions. Therefore, a more realistic solids transportation prediction can be achieved. A simulation package is developed by solving the model using the finite difference method. The boundary-fitted coordinate system is applied to integrate the irregular geometry caused by drillpipe eccentricity and a packed solids bed. The influence of the solid phase on the carrier fluid is considered, and solid-liquid two-way coupling is implemented.The simulation package has been used for transient hole cleaning simulations during drilling. Simulation results show that cuttings’ backsliding makes the hole cleaning process in intermediate inclined wells different from that in horizontal and highly inclined wells. The cuttings movement in this part of the well follows the two-steps-forward, one-step-back routine. Well packoff is also captured by the program for improper hole cleaning operations in an intermediated inclined position. Transient hole cleaning tests were conducted on a 90 ft long, 8 × 4.5 in. flow loop. Experimental data are compared with the simulation results, and good matching is obtained. This method can also be used as a general tool for solids suspension and transportation simulation in multiphase systems.},

It has been observed that in all drag reduction regimes from the onset of DR to maximum drag reduction (MDR) limit, the Deborah number is defined as the product of an effective Weissenberg number, and the root mean square streamwise vorticity fluctuation remains O(1) in the near wall region. The ratio of the average lifetime of axial vortices to the vortex rotating duration decreases with increasing DR, and MDR is achieved when these time scales become nearly equal. Based on these observations a simple framework is proposed adequately to describe the influence of polymer additives on the extent of DR from onset to MDR as well as the universality of the MDR in flow systems with polymer additives.},

  abstract = {We have performed experimental and theoretical studies on cuttings transport in directional wells for more than 15 years. During that time, we developed a one-dimensional (1D) two-layer model transient cuttings transport simulator that predicts the transient behaviors of cuttings bed height, suspended cuttings concentration, cuttings slip velocity, annular pressure, and equivalent circulating density (ECD) along the entire trajectory of the complex extended-reach well. Model parameters, such as annulus friction factor, cuttings deposition rate, and re-entrainment rate, were determined on the basis of numerous experiments we previously performed using a large-scale cuttings transport flow-loop apparatus developed to simulate complex flows in borehole annuli with various inclination angles from vertical to horizontal. In this study, we performed model validation and cuttings transport analysis using field data in a directional well where the annulus ECD was measured by logging while drilling (LWD), and the returned cuttings rate was measured at the surface. On the basis of the simulation study, we discussed the potential of the transient cuttings transport simulator developed in the predrilling and postdrilling phase analyses and real-time analysis during drilling. Moreover, we demonstrated the interpretation of LWD data and the appropriate management of the ECD and evaluated the hole cleaning condition from the LWD data.},

  abstract = {The problem of solid cleanout in horizontal wellbores is studied experimentally. The special case of drilling fluid circulation with no inner pipe rotation is considered. This case is similar to Coiled tubing drilling where often hole cleanout must be performed. Sand sized cuttings (ranging from 260 micron to 1240 micron) are used. Critical velocity and wall shear stress required for initiating bed erosion are measured. Water and viscous polymer base fluids with 3 different polymer concentrations are used. Results have shown that water always initiate cuttings movement at lower flow rates than polymer solutions. Fluids with higher polymer concentration and hence with higher viscosity required higher flow rates to start eroding the bed. Critical wall shear stress is also determined from pressure loss measurements. Analyzing the data revealed that water initiate cuttings removal at lower pressure loss than more viscous fluids. Higher viscosity fluids always showed higher pressure loss at the initiation of bed erosion. For the range of cuttings size studied, results show that intermediate cuttings size is easier to remove. Smallest and largest cuttings are more difficult to move requiring higher flow rates and higher pressure losses. Dimensionless analysis of relevant parameters to the process of cuttings movement is performed. It is shown that dimensionless wall shear stress (in the forms of Shield's stress and also ratio of shear velocity to settling velocity) correlates well with particles Reynolds number. Based on this finding two correlations are developed to predict wall shear stress required for initiating cuttings movement under different conditions.},

  doi = {10.1016/0377-0257(94)01282-M},
  abstract = {Slip occurs in the flow of two-phase systems because of the displacement of the disperse phase away from solid boundaries. This arises from steric, hydrodynamic, viscoelastic and chemical forces and constraints acting on the disperse phase immediately adjacent to the walls. The enrichment of the boundary near the wall with the continuous (and usually low-viscosity) phase means that any flow of the fluid over the boundary is easier because of the lubrication effect. Because this effect is usually confined to a very narrow layer — with typical thickness of 0.1–10 μm—it so resembles the slip of solids over surfaces that it has historically been given the same terminology. The restoring force for all the forces that cause an increase in concentration is usually osmotic, and this will always limit the effective slip. In dilute systems, concentration gradients can be present over relatively large distances out from walls, giving what might be interpreted on an overall basis as a thick solvent-only layer. However, as the concentration of the system increases, the layer gets thinner and thinner because it is more difficult to create with the large reverse osmotic force present. However, the enormous increase in the bulk viscosity with increase in concentration means that although thinner, the layer becomes, paradoxically, even more important. Slip manifests itself in such a way that viscosity measured in different size geometries gives different answers if calculated the normal way — in particular the apparent viscosity decreases with decrease in geometry size (e.g. tube radius). Also, in single flow curves unexpected lower Newtonian plateaus are sometimes seen, with an apparent yield stress at even lower stresses. Sudden breaks in the flow curve can also be seen. Large particles as the disperse phase (remember flocs are large particles), with a large dependence of viscosity on the concentration of the dispersed phase are the circumstances which can give slip, especially if coupled with smooth walls and small flow dimensions. The effect is usually greatest at low speeds/flow rates. When the viscometer walls and particles carry like electrostatic charges and the continuous phase is electrically conducted, slip can be assumed. In many cases we need to characterise the slip effects seen in viscometers because they will also be seen in flow in smooth pipes and condults in manufacturing plants. This is usually done by relating the wall shear stress to a slip velocity using a power-law relationship. When the bulk flow has also been characterized, the flow in real situations can be calculated. To characterise slip, it is necessary to change the size of the geometry, and the results extrapolated to very large size to extract unambigouos bulk-flow and slip data respectively. A number of mathematical manipulations are necessary to retrieve these data. We can make attempts to eliminate slip by altering the physical or chemical character of the walls. This is usually done physically by roughening or profiling, but in the extreme, a vane can be used. This latter geometry has the advantage of being easy to make and clean. In either case—by extrapolation or elimination—we end up with the bulk flow properties. This is important in situations where we are trying to understand the microstructure/flow interactions.},

  abstract = {Anisotropic particles are common in many industrial and natural turbulent flows. When these particles are small and neutrally buoyant, they follow Lagrangian trajectories while exhibiting rich orientational dynamics from the coupling of their rotation to the velocity gradients of the turbulence field. This system has proven to be a fascinating application of the fundamental properties of velocity gradients in turbulence. When particles are not neutrally buoyant, they experience preferential concentration and very different preferential alignment than neutrally buoyant tracer particles. A vast proportion of the parameter range of anisotropic particles in turbulence is still unexplored, with most existing research focusing on the simple foundational cases of axisymmetric ellipsoids at low concentrations in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and in turbulent channel flow. Numerical simulations and experiments have recently developed a fairly comprehensive picture of alignment and rotation in these cases, and they provide an essential foundation for addressing more complex problems of practical importance. Macroscopic effects of nonspherical particle dynamics include preferential concentration in coherent structures and drag reduction by fiber suspensions. We review the models used to describe nonspherical particle motion, along with numerical and experimental methods for measuring particle dynamics.},

The examples given illustrate that proppant settling during fracture closure can be important in the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment. Field data illustrate the time required for fracture closure.

The computer program which models the fracturing process uses proppant settling velocities obtained from extensive laboratory data collected under simulated fracturing conditions. Proppant settling predictions include the effects of non-Newtonian fluids, concentrated slurries of proppant, fracture walls, and changes in fluid temperatures along the fracture. These substantially affect the settling velocity of the proppant and must be considered to obtain a realistic prediction of proppant transport.},

  abstract = {This study aims to improve the predictive capabilities of flow pattern and depositional behaviour of non-Newtonian, high concentration sand and fines mixtures. The depositional behaviour influences the geometry of the deposit and the distribution of sand and fines particles, which in turn influence the strength and consolidation performance of the deposit. Ultimately this affects the area reclamation targets from the mining industry. In this study an existing numerical model, Delft3D (a three-dimensional, open source flow model from Deltares utilized world-wide in various hydrodynamic and sediment transport studies), is extended with the physics that describe non-Newtonian rheology and sand settling in shear flow. The rheology determines the yield stress and viscosity of a fluid. Shear induced sand settling occurs for fluids with a yield stress. Sand settles under shear whereas smaller particles stay suspended, producing segregation. Segregation leads to non-uniformity in deposit composition (e.g sand and fines dominated areas). Rheology and sand settling mutually interact, directly influencing deposition patterns. This study is a continuation of the work of [Hanssen, 2016], who included specific rheology and sand settling formulation in a one-dimensional version of Delft3D (i.e. 1DV). As part of this work, further verification of this one-dimensional model has been performed and the model has been extended to two-dimensional vertical (i.e. 2DV in a longitudinal cross section). The extended model has been tested in 2DV with deposition over a 400 meters slope. A sensitivity analysis is performed to consider the effect of different solid contents and rheological properties. The model is also tested on specific oil sand applications and data, such as tailings deposition down a beach, mutual interaction of tailings with different rheology or strength and a characterization of fines capture compared with data. This study proved that the extended version of Delft3D can simulate a 2DV non-Newtonian high density flow including sand settling. However there are still some physical processes where the model needs improvements or further research is needed, such as laminar-turbulence regime; transition to 3D and the motion of sand layers. Further model verification and development goes hands in hands with a good data set. Specifically important are flume/field tests with rheology data and its variation with time, especially for polymer added tailings, to verify the model.},

  abstract = {Whether viscosity or elasticity is more important for proppant suspending in fracturing fluids is a long standing controversial issue. In this study, the contributions of viscosity and elasticity to proppant suspending are quantified and decoupled for the first time for a model hydraulic fracturing fluid Carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar gel (CMHPG) cross-linked with borate. This is achieved by measuring the settling velocity of a single particle under shear flow in a transparent Couette flow cell using a CCD camera and an automatic particle tracking software. In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms of proppant suspending, the rheological behavior and possible flow instabilities were also monitored and the local flow field was mapped using particle tracking velocimetry. In the borate crosslinked CMHPG gel, the particle settling slows down with the increase in the imposed shear rate and the settling essentially stops at sufficiently high shear rates. The settling velocity data and rheological results suggest that there are two main mechanisms for the enhanced particle suspending under shear: shear thickening and elastic lifting. The relative importance of the two factors depends on the shear rate and fluid relaxation time. Specifically, the ratio of the elastic and viscous contribution to particle suspending is related to the product of fluid relaxation time and first normal stress difference divided by the shear viscosity. For the crosslinked CMHPG gel studied here, it is determined the viscosity is more important at shear rates smaller than 2 s-1 whereas the elasticity becomes dominant at shear rates larger than 2 s-1. The elucidation of the relative importance of viscosity and elasticity provides valuable guidance in optimizing fracture fluid design to maximize its proppant transport power. For example, depending on the well condition and fluid type, one may wish to optimize either the viscosity or elasticity of a fracturing fluid to maximize proppant transport into fractures.},

  abstract = {Summary. In hydraulic fracturing treatments, the success of the treatment strongly depends on the proper placement proppant particles in the fracture. "Proper placement" means the packing of the fracture to achieve maximum conductivity of gas/oil through the fracture into the wellbore. The placement of the proppants along the fracture is based on design equations where sand transport velocity is related to the rheological parameters of the fracturing fluid and characteristics of the proppant particle, such size and density. The present work describes the theoretical transport equations that take into account the elasticity of the fluid in predicting proppant settling rate in the fracture. It presents the rheological data of commonly used fracturing fluids (titanate and borate crosslinked), including viscous and elastic parameter measurements made with a Rheometrics Pressure Rheometer TM (RPR) and Rheometrics Mechanical Spectrometer TM (RMS-800). These data show some important differences between borate crosslinked gels and titanate crosslinked gels. The paper also presents experimental data of proppant settling rates in various fracturing fluids and how these can be correlated with rheological parameters obtained in this work. The difference in rheology between borate and titanate gels was correlated with the difference in settling rates of proppants in these two gels. The theoretical and experimental work presented here led to the conclusion that the model for proppant placement in a hydraulic fracture should include: (1) proppant characteristics, (2) viscous rheological parameters (K and n), (3) elastic parameters (complex dynamic viscosity) from linear viscoelastic constitutive equation, and (4) normal stress difference from nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive equation. The influence of crosslinked-polymer-gel network structure on proppant transport is also discussed. IntroductionThe sand transport in crosslinked fracturing gels is an important parameter that needs to he understood in terms of its relationship to fluid rheology and pumping parameters.

  abstract = {While shear thickening is a well-known feature of some polymer solutions, its observation in the absence of a clear specific chemical or structural mechanism and at very low rates of shear (shear rate ≤ 0.1/s) in our own data, as well as in several polymer systems in the literature, has prompted further investigation. Using the rheologically-reproducible and commercially available dysphagia product ResourceÒ Thicken Up Clear (produced by Nestle Health Science) as a canonical demonstration fluid, we show that the observation of a local maximum in the steady shear viscosity at very low shear rates can be completely attributed to the sample not having reached steady state conditions, and correspondingly, to the measurement not having been performed in steady simple shear flow. We propose two criteria to ensure equilibration during steady state flow rheological measurements: a substantial increase in the measurement time allotted for each point such that the total material strain accumulated in the sample is allowed to reach shear strain ≤ 5 and/or a stricter convergence criterion of 10 consecutive readings within a tolerance of 1\%.},

  abstract = {We present a one-parameter model that fits quantitatively the mean velocity profiles from experiments and numerical simulations of drag-reduced wall-bounded flows of dilute solutions of polymers and non-Brownian fibers in the low and modest drag reduction regime. The model is based on a viscous mechanism of drag reduction, in which either extended polymers or non-Brownian fibers increase the extensional viscosity of the fluid and thereby suppress both small and large turbulent eddies and reduce momentum transfer to the wall, resulting in drag reduction. Our model provides a rheological interpretation of the upward parallel shift S+ in the mean velocity profile upon addition of polymer, observed by Virk. We show that Virk's correlations for the dependence on polymer molecular weight and concentration of the onset wall shear stress and slope increment on the Prandtl-Karman plot can be translated to two dimensionless numbers, namely an onset Weissenberg number and an asymptotic Trouton ratio of maximum extensional viscosity to zero-shear viscosity. We believe that our model, while simple, captures the essential features of drag reduction that are universal to flexible polymers and fibers, and, unlike the Virk phenomenology, can easily be extended to flows with inhomogeneous polymer or fiber concentration fields.},

  abstract = {The problem of solids cleanout in horizontal wellbores was studied experimentally. The special case of drilling-fluid circulation with no inner-pipe rotation was considered. This case is similar to coiled tubing (CT) drilling in which frequent hole cleanout must be performed. Sand-sized cuttings (ranging from 260 to 1240 µm) were used. Critical velocity and wall shear stress required for starting bed erosion were measured. Water and viscous-polymer base fluids with three different polymer concentrations were used. Results have shown that water always starts cuttings movement at lower flow rates than polymer solutions. Fluids with higher polymer concentration (and higher viscosity) required higher flow rates to start eroding the bed. Critical wall shear stress was also determined from pressure-loss measurements. Analyzing the data revealed that water starts cuttings removal at lower pressure loss than more-viscous fluids. Higher-viscosity fluids always showed higher pressure loss at the start of bed erosion. For the range of cuttings size studied, results show that an intermediate cuttings size was slightly easier to remove. However, the impact of cuttings size was far less than that of fluid rheology. Overall cuttings size was found to have a small impact on hole cleaning. Dimensionless analysis of parameters relevant to the process of cuttings movement was performed. It was shown that dimensionless wall shear stress (in the forms of Shields’ stress and also ratio of shear velocity to settling velocity) at the onset of bed erosion correlated well with particle Reynolds number. On the basis of this finding, two correlations were developed to predict critical wall shear stress. A procedure was developed to calculate critical flow rate as well. Friction-factor data for the flow through the annulus with a stationary cuttings bed are also reported.},

  shorttitle = {{{FEDSM2013}}-16204},
  abstract = {It is essential to transport cuttings generated in drilling operations to the surface for disposal. As the inclination of wellbore increases, cuttings begin to deposit in the lower section of the wellbore, and develop cuttings bed. This developed bed increases the mechanical friction between the drillstring and the wellbore. As a result, problems such as increase in torque, decrease in force transfer to the bit, and poor control of the bottom hole pressure arise. Estimation of total concentration of cuttings inside the wellbore has never been an easy task. Cuttings and fluid dragging them to be transported have different relative velocities inside the wellbore, causing variations in pressure drop. Hence, a better understanding in cuttings–liquid interactions inside the wellbore is required.In this study, the interactions between cuttings and drilling fluid in horizontal eccentric annulus were simulated and observed using commercial Computational Fluid. CFD software program has proven to be a successful tool in studying complex fluid mechanic problems that are difficult to solve analytically. The effect of fluid flow rate and the impact of the rate of penetration (ROP) on flow patterns, cuttings concentration and pressure losses were investigated and validated using data obtained from Middle East Technical University Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering Department Cuttings Transport / Multiphase Flow Loop. The drilling fluid of study is limited to water, a Newtonian fluid. The results obtained from the simulations show good agreement with the experiments. As the drilling fluid flow rate increases, the flow pattern was observed changing from stationary bed to dispersed flow, which complies with experimental results and literature findings. Increase in flow rate overcomes the gravitational force that pulls the cuttings downward and increases the surface forces that lift the cuttings up to the surface. Consequently, by increasing annular flow rate, cuttings concentration is decreased. On the other hand, the increment in ROP leads to more cuttings generated and more cuttings accumulation in the well bore. In conclusion, fluid flow rate and ROP are both significant factors in hole cleaning operations. The higher the flow rate, the higher the efficiency of hole cleaning, whereas the higher the ROP, the less efficient is the hole cleaning. CFD is proven to be successfully applied to predict the solid concentration in the well. Therefore this tool can be used for more complex cases, and the information provides can be very useful especially when there is no any other data available.},

  volume = {In Review},
  abstract = {For the purpose of improving CFD models of particle transport in wellbore flows, i.e. cuttings transport, we have extended the Lagrangian Discrete-Particle-Model model of the commercial code ANSYS Fluent 17.2 to describe the motion of a particle settling in a shear-thinning, mildly viscoelastic orthogonal shear flow. Essentially, the fluid strain rate as the magnitude of the fluid deformation rate tensor is corrected by a particle-induced shear rate. This corrected strain rate is used to compute an apparent viscosity. The fluid is treated as a Generalized Newtonian Fluid using Cross and Carreau material functions. Different drag laws are investigated, including one which accounts for the fluids viscoelastic wake structure behavior via a correction term. We validate the model with eight different particle trajectories representing different combinations of particle diameters, fluid flow rates and rheological properties (water and polymeric solutions) provided by Khatibi et al (2016) [1].
In general, the experimental trajectories are satisfactorily replicated by the CFD model. However, for small particles a trajectory mismatch is observed close to the lower channel wall. We find this mismatch to be a consequence of unexpectedly high particle x-velocities in the experimental data. Various possible causes are identified and discussed. More detailed experimental near-wall data of both particle and fluid velocities as well as more sophisticated modeling of the fluids rheology, including the rheology effect on the forces acting on the particles, may be required to minimize the mismatch.
In addition, we further conclude that in case of the polymeric solutions particle drag is the dominant particle force, that the viscoelastic wake of the particle is not significantly affecting the trajectories and that a Newtonian drag law may be used as long as the particle-induced shear rate is estimated with ‖v\_r ‖/d\_p and a material function accounting for the limiting zero-shear Newtonian viscosity is applied.},

  abstract = {Abstract APIT is a computational software based system which performs real-time test analysis, reporting and automated result interpretation of FITs/LOTs/XLOTs based on surface and downhole data. This paper presents the challenges for the current pressure integrity testing and introduced a new solution called automated pressure testing (APIT) system. This has included system framework and integration to cementing units, models and algorithms to determine system compliance and fluid leakage, fracture closure pressure, calibration techniques and validated results. Based on a minimum of preconfigured user input, the APIT system covers all test phases, from pressurization, fracture propagation to shut-in and flowback. The system identifies unexpected test behavior and triggers warnings by continuously evaluating key test metrics such as leakage rate, system compliance and surface pressure during each test phase. This APIT system was tested optimized and validated using various historical field data in order to provide Proof-of-Concept of algorithms, test sequences and graphics user interface (GUI). Both successful and unsuccessful data chosen from NCS and the international arena were tested. The automatic interpretation algorithms from APIT are aligned with manual test interpretation performed internally in Statoil. The APIT system is believed to be a safer and more efficient pressure testing alternative to the current manual counterpart.},

  title = {On Pragmatism in Industrial Modeling},
  abstract = {Many natural or industrial processes are of extreme complexity, and where the time- and length scales range from atomistic level to years and kilometers. Often the processes or phenomena consist of multiple sub processes in which each comprises its own length and time scales. An example can be production of aluminum by the Hall-Heroult process, where process streams or raw materials, flow dynamics and segregation in silos, with time varying quality, the feeding and operational routines, the reduction cells with numerous sub processes, and the tapping process, all make up a complete process. To optimize such type of production with respect to economic and environmental parameters we will have to develop models which can give the overall picture and at the same time be accurate enough to support the optimization process. As there are many dynamic aspects of an industrial production, the ultimate need will be a model which can compute much faster than real time and which can be used to support operation and to develop new processes. In this paper we discuss how this type of pragmatic industrial models can be developed. We will identify and discuss the tools needed for such an analyses, including the analyses process itself and the frameworks needed for such analyses. Key elements in our pragmatic modeling concepts are human knowledge, including capabilities to understand complex phenomena and how these can be modeled simplified but "good enough", systematic use of existing information, systematic analyses of what information (model results) is needed and at with which accuracy and speed the results must be produced. Another key element is the selection and collection of experiment data and the exploitation of data, organized and made accessible in the optimal manner to support the predictiveness of the pragmatism based model. The organization of all types of data is organized by a "bridge" (modeling middleware) between complex scientific (aspect/phenomenon oriented) physical models, simplified models and process data. We believe that this type of pragmatic industrial models will enable a step change in both operation, operator training and process optimization, as well as design of new processes. Finally, in a case study, we apply our pragmatic modeling concept to the aluminum production process and discuss the implications of our proposed concept.},

The study was carried out using the computer controlled RheoStress RS100 system of Haake. CMC concentration in the test solutions ranged by weight from 1 to 5\%. This range was sufficiently wide to reveal the nearly Newtonian behavior at the lower end of concentrations, and the definitely pseudoplastic, thixotropic, and viscoelastic behaviors of CMC solutions at the higher end of concentrations. The scope of the study included measurements of steady-state parameters, transient shear stress response, and yield stress. In addition, the thixotropic, creep recovery, and dynamic responses of solutions with high concentrations were measured. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 64: 289–301, 1997},

  abstract = {Introduction

It is almost certain that problems will occur while drilling a well, even in very carefully planned wells. For example, in areas in which similar drilling practices are used, hole problems may have been reported where no such problems existed previously because formations are nonhomogeneous. Therefore, two wells near each other may have totally different geological conditions.

In well planning, the key to achieving objectives successfully is to design drilling programs on the basis of anticipation of potential hole problems rather than on caution and containment. Drilling problems can be very costly. The most prevalent drilling problems include pipe sticking, lost circulation, hole deviation, pipe failures, borehole instability, mud contamination, formation damage, hole cleaning, H2S-bearing formation and shallow gas, and equipment and personnel-related problems.

Understanding and anticipating drilling problems, understanding their causes, and planning solutions are necessary for overall-well-cost control and for successfully reaching the target zone. This chapter addresses these problems, possible solutions, and, in some cases, preventive measures.},

  abstract = {Abstract After drilling out cement at the start of a new wellbore section, a formation integrity test is routinely performed to verify the integrity of the new formation and the cement at the casing shoe. Test results can have large impacts on the drilling operation, such as motivating remedial cementing operations, changing the drilling fluid mass density or the setting depth of casing strings. Interpretation of the test results are often made difficult for a number of reasons, including significant fluid losses to permeable formations, large friction pressure losses, compression of trapped air and unstable pump operation. This paper presents a new supervisory system providing real-time test analysis and automated result interpretation of pressure integrity tests, leak-off tests and extended leak-off tests. Based on a minimum of preconfigured user input, the system covers all test phases, from pressurization, fracture propagation to shut-in and flowback. Rather than relying on computationally intensive modelling of downhole physics, regression techniques are applied to relate surface pressure to injected fluid volume, shut-in duration and volume or time in flowback. System compliance and fluid leakage rates are determined prior to leak-off using a nonlinear regression model. The calibrated model is in turn used to generate prediction intervals for detecting leak-off and fracture pressures. Extended leak-off interpretation is based on the system stiffness approach, in which fracture closure is associated with a reduction in system compliance. We apply regression techniques to search for fracture closure during shut-in and during flowback. The system identifies unexpected test behavior and triggers warnings by continuously evaluating key test metrics such as leakage rate, system compliance and surface pressure during each test phase. The development is based on few model assumptions. Low-pass filtering combined with regression techniques ensure that the system is capable of analyzing field tests of variable quality and with noisy surface sensor measurements. We assess the performance based on historical tests that are representative of the variation in possible pressure-volume behaviors and with typical noise levels on input sensor signals. The system output corresponds well with the original manual test interpretations, and provides in most cases reliable determination of leak-off and fracture pressures, fracture propagation and fracture closure pressures. Real-time test supervisory functionality in addition to standardization of test interpretation and data storage are immediate benefits of system implementation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) enables safer operations and reduces non-productive time and thus provides the opportunity to reduce well costs. Many operators however, are not fully embracing the opportunity offered by the technology, due to strict regulatory requirements, and their perception that MPD is complicated and increases risk. A basis for this perception is that operator engineers in their designs, and contractor drilling crews in day-to-day operations, are insufficiently MPD experienced to fully and safely exploit the benefits of the technology. Today, the advanced, and field proven, engineering (mathematical) models that are part and parcel of the software used in well design are also available in state of the art simulators. These engineering models and model based simulators are used by engineers during the design phase of MPD projects to replicate the conditions that will be encountered during actual well construction; picking optimal casing setting depths, using different equipment set-ups, selecting optimal drilling parameters and demonstrating the integrity of the design under a wide scenario of well conditions. Once the well design is finalized, and before drilling operations commence, the same well design is programmed into a real-time drilling simulator. During subsequent simulator exercises,, rig personnel are exposed to the range of scenarios that can unfold during actual operations, taking into account uncertainties and unexpected events. Crews, at the hard end of operations, are able to hone their competence to deal with the unexpected in a team environment under the supervision and guidance of experienced coaches. During actual MPD operations, the same advanced models can be used for automatic simulation and well monitoring purposes; they can also be integrated into the MPD control system to accurately maintain the required well pressures. This paper describes the models used and both the classroom simulator-based engineering training and the real-time rig floor simulator training that will respectively provide operator engineers and contractor well site staff the in-depth understanding of MPD that will enable them to develop their respective skills to safely and cost effectively exploit the many benefits offered by MPD.},

  abstract = {The flow of an idealized granular material consisting of uniform smooth, but nelastic, spherical particles is studied using statistical methods analogous to those used in the kinetic theory of gases. Two theories are developed: one for the Couette flow of particles having arbitrary coefficients of restitution (inelastic particles) and a second for the general flow of particles with coefficients of restitution near 1 (slightly inelastic particles). The study of inelastic particles in Couette flow follows the method of Savage \&amp; Jeffrey (1981) and uses an ad hoc distribution function to describe the collisions between particles. The results of this first analysis are compared with other theories of granular flow, with the Chapman-Enskog dense-gas theory, and with experiments. The theory agrees moderately well with experimental data and it is found that the asymptotic analysis of Jenkins \&amp; Savage (1983), which was developed for slightly inelastic particles, surprisingly gives results similar to the first theory even for highly inelastic particles. Therefore the ‘nearly elastic’ approximation is pursued as a second theory using an approach that is closer to the established methods of Chapman-Enskog gas theory. The new approach which determines the collisional distribution functions by a rational approximation scheme, is applicable to general flowfields, not just simple shear. It incorporates kinetic as well as collisional contributions to the constitutive equations for stress and energy flux and is thus appropriate for dilute as well as dense concentrations of solids. When the collisional contributions are dominant, it predicts stresses similar to the first analysis for the simple shear case.},

  abstract = {The stress tensor in a granular shear flow is calculated by supposing that binary collisions between the particles comprising the granular mass are responsible for most of the momentum transport. We assume that the particles are smooth, hard, elastic spheres and express the stress as an integral containing probability distribution functions for the velocities of the particles and for their spatial arrangement. By assuming that the single-particle velocity distribution function is Maxwellian and that the spatial pair distribution function is given by a formula due to Carnahan \&amp; Starling, we reduce this integral to one depending upon a single non-dimensional parameter R: the ratio of the characteristic mean shear velocity to the root mean square of the precollisional particle-velocity perturbation. The integral is evaluated asymptotically for R [Gt      ] 1 and R [Lt      ] 1 and numerically for intermediate values. Good agreement is found between the stresses measured in experiments on dry granular materials and the theoretical predictions when R is given the value 1·7. This case is probably the one for which the present analysis is most appropriate. For moderate and large values of R, the theory predicts both shear and normal stresses that are proportional to the square of the particle diameter and the square of the shear rate, and depend strongly on the solids volume fraction. A provisional comparison is made between the stresses predicted in the limit R → ∞ and the experimental results of Bagnold for shear flow of neutrally buoyant wax spheres suspended in water. The predicted stresses are of the correct order of magnitude and yield the proper variation of stress with concentration. When R [Lt      ] 1, the shear stress is linear in the shear rate, and the analysis can be applied to shear flow in a fluidized bed, although such an application is not developed further here.},

  title = {Study of Sediment Transport Processes Using {{Reynolds Averaged Navier}}-{{Stokes}} and {{Large Eddy Simulation}}},
  url = {http://mech.vub.ac.be/thermodynamics/phd/PhD_thesis_Patryk_Widera.pdf},
  abstract = {Sedimentation processes play a crucial role in human environment. Numerous
examples of sediment transport and sedimentation problems can
be given, e.g. unwanted dust in our living areas, dust in electronic devices,
problems with deposition efficiency of inhaled medicines, problems with
uncontrolled sand transport in rivers or with transport of any kind of pollutants
in water or in the air and industrial examples as pneumatic transport
or cyclone separation. Contemporary knowledge about the processes
that are involved in the particle transport, in the inter-particle or fluidparticle
coupling is still very small. The prediction of sediment behavior
in industrial calculations usually is based on simple, empirical formulas,
which are applicable only for simple and very specific cases. Even with
such an approach, the error of the prediction of sediment concentration
can reach dozens or hundreds of percents. The sediment concentration error
can be even bigger in large areas as lakes, rivers or harbors, where the
amount of variables influencing the sediment transport is larger and less
predictable.
However, the improvement of the numerical methods and computing power
raise a distinct possibility to develop more advanced models that can give
the solution to sediment transport issue in a relatively short time with
reasonably high accuracy. The increasing computational power allows to
use such methodologies as, e.g. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) in order to try to investigate the patterns
of sediment transport in turbulent flows. Unsteady simulations give the
opportunity to investigate particle behavior on the smallest scales, which
is necessary to understand the physics of particle movement and particle
response to turbulent fluid motions.
The main goal of this thesis is to develop an efficient numerical algorithm
to simulate sediment transport in the presence of turbulent flows.
The current study is based on the LES approach, where advanced subgrid
scale models are used to capture small scales of unsteady turbulent
flows, i.e. the Smagorinsky and the WALE (Wall-Adapting Local Eddy)
based models. In most of the considered cases the dilute flow assumption
is applied, i.e. the sediment concentration is small enough to consider its
influence to flow field as negligible. The only exception is the study presented
in Chapter 8, where the sediment phase is coupled with the fluid
phase using the varying viscosity and settling velocity model. In case when dilute flow is considered, the sediment concentration profiles are validated
against the theoretical curve calculated based on the Rouse equation.
As first, the sediment transport in an open and closed channel with smooth
walls was studied. The results presented in Chapter 5 show good agreement
of the LES based sediment concentration when compared to the theoretical
curve. Additionally, it is shown that the RANS solution can be improved
when the turbulent Schmidt number is defined based on the LES
solution, when dilute flow condition is assumed.
In Chapter 6, the study of the sediment transport in the rough bottom
channel is presented. The LES solution obtained from the rough bottom
simulations were used to study the sediment transport patterns and also
served as reference data for development of the two-equation turbulence
model in Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes framework, see Heredia [55].
The basic, classical sediment-fluid coupling models are studied and described
in Chapter 8. The coupling between fluid and sediment is based
on the varying viscosity and varying settling model, i.e. model of Toda
and Hisamoto [131] and Van Rijn [148], respectively. As it was expected,
obtained results confirmed that even a relatively small amount of the sediment
particles (in this case the volumetric concentration is 1 and 2\%) can
influence the flow field. It is also confirmed that the small particles influence
the flow field less, when compared to the influence of bigger particles,
assuming the same volumetric concentration.
Chapter 9 presents the study of the slip velocity models proposed by Manninen
et al. [84]. As has been proved, the velocity and the pressure based
models significantly improve solution accuracy of the Eulerian model for
large particles, especially in the developed flow region. However, it is found
that neglecting the turbulent and the viscous stresses results in low accuracy
in the wall vicinity. Hence, it is suggested that the near wall properties
of both models should be further investigated. Additionally, a simple
correction method for the pressure based model is presented.
As has been shown in the study, the applied methodology, i.e. sediment
transport using LES, can give a very detailed picture of the sediment behavior,
including sediment concentration, its response to the turbulent
fluctuations and sediment transport patterns. Nevertheless, to recognize
results of numerical simulations as fully correct, they should also be validated
against experimental results. That still seems to be an unresolved
problem in some cases, e.g. flows with high concentration of particles.},

  title = {New {{Friction Factor Correlations}} of {{Non}}-{{Newtonian Fluid Flow}} in {{Coiled Tubing}}},
  doi = {10.2118/77960-PA},
  abstract = {Summary This paper presents a complete set of friction-factor correlations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in laminar and turbulent flow in coiled tubing. The friction-factor correlation for non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow is based on theoretical analysis and numerical solutions of the flow equations of a power-law-model fluid in curved pipes. The empirical correlation for non-Newtonian fluids in~turbulent flow is based on full-scale experiments of polymeric-fluid systems in various 1-, 1½-, and 2?-in. coiled-tubing reels. To consider the effect of pipe roughness in coiled tubing, a modified correlation is proposed by combining the Srinivasan et al. correlation (Srinivasan et al. 1970)~for smooth, curved pipe and the Chen correlation (Chen 1979) for rough, straight pipe. Examples are given to illustrate the applications and accuracies of the newly developed correlations. Introduction The friction factor in curved pipe at a given Reynolds number is greater than that in straight pipe because of the existence of secondary flow, which is caused by the effect of centrifugal forces in curved-flow geometry. Dean (1927, 1928) conducted the first theoretical study of Newtonian fluid flow in curved pipes by solving the momentum and continuity equations using a successive approximation method. A recent literature review indicates that the flow of Newtonian fluids in curved pipes has been studied extensively since the pioneering work of Dean (Zhou and Shah 2004). In contrast, the information on studies of non-Newtonian fluid flow in curved pipes is relatively scarce. Coiled tubing has been successfully used in the oil and gas industry for well drilling, completion, wellbore cleanout, stimulation, and other field operations. In these coiled-tubing applications, fluids—typically non-Newtonian—are generally pumped through the coiled tubing. Because of the small diameter and excessive friction loss caused by secondary flow, the maximum pumping rate obtainable is often limited. For engineering design purposes, correlations are needed to accurately predict the frictional pressure losses in the coiled-tubing string and the pumping power requirement. The present work is an effort to meet such needs by providing a complete set of friction-factor correlations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids under laminar- and turbulent-flow conditions. For non-Newtonian laminar flow, a new correlation is developed through the boundary-layer approximation analysis and by using the numerical solution of the flow equations of a power-law-model fluid in coiled tubing. The correlation is presented in an empirical form for convenience. For non-Newtonian turbulent flow, a new correlation is established on the basis of the recent experiments performed using a full-scale coiled-tubing flow test facility. A modified correlation for turbulent Newtonian fluid flow is also proposed to include the effect of pipe roughness. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the application of these new correlations and their accuracies in estimating friction factors of fluid flowing in coiled tubing.},

Specifications on rheometers are not as straight forward as in many other analytical instruments as there are so many factors influencing the measurement.
 
Still we specify +-1\% accuracy on the flowcurve if you are in range. That means above 10 µNm in torque. The instruments are typically much better than that.
 
Attached you find information about the minimum the MCR xx2 series can achieve with live results to prove it. As you can see the MCR is far better than the spec in the brochure.
 
Most other rheometer suppliers are the opposite, writing specs in the brochure that only can be reached in ideal conditions (at best).

  abstract = {Abstract An experimental study is performed to understand and quantify settling velocity of spherical particles in unbounded and confined surfactant-based shear thinning viscoelastic fluids. Experimental data is presented to show that elastic effects can increase or decrease the settling velocity of particles, even in the creeping flow regime. Experimental data shows that a significant drag reduction occurs with increase in Weissenberg number. This is followed by a transition to increasing drag at higher Weissenberg numbers. A new correlation is presented for the sphere settling velocity in unbounded viscoelastic fluids as a function of the fluid rheology and the proppant properties. The wall factors for sphere settling velocities in viscoelastic fluids confined between solid parallel plates are calculated from experimental measurements made on these fluids over a range of Weissenberg numbers. Results indicate that elasticity reduces the effect of the confining walls and this reduction is more pronounced at higher ratios of the particle diameter to spacing between the walls. Shear thinning behavior of fluids is observed to reduce the retardation effect of the confining walls. A new empirical correlation for wall factors for spheres settling in a viscoelastic fluid confined between two parallel walls is presented.},

  abstract = {AbstractExperimental data and analysis are presented on the static and dynamic settling of proppant in non-Newtonian hydraulic fracturing fluids. A unique High Pressure Simulator (HPS) that closely models reservoir hydraulic fractures is used to study proppant-settling behavior under both static and dynamic conditions. A system of optical fibers and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) acting as a vision system were imbedded in the platens representing fracture walls for quantification of proppant settling under various fluid injection conditions. Hydraulic fracturing fluids tested include slurries of 35 lb/Mgal guar linear gel with 6 ppg 20/40 mesh sand, 60 and 40 lb/ Mgal hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) linear gels both with 4 ppg 20/40 mesh sand, and borate-crosslinked 35 lb/Mgal guar gel with 7.3 ppg 20/40 mesh sand. Test conditions cover a shear rate range of 60 to 120 sec-1. In addition, the effect of an enzyme breaker on proppant settling rate under static conditions was studied. Tests were conducted with a fracture gap width of 0.375 in. under ambient conditions. Analysis of the dynamic condition indicates that proppant settling within the linear and crosslinked gels investigated is non-linearly dependent on shear rate. Under static conditions, linear gel slurries settled 40 to 50 times faster than the crosslinked gel containing breaker. It is also shown that an increase in shear rate induces proppant settling in borate-crosslinked 35 lb/Mgal guar gel while it reduces the settling rate in 35 lb/Mgal guar linear gel. IntroductionWhen a particle settles in a given fluid and its fall is not affected by the boundaries of the container or by the presence of other surrounding particles, the process is referred to as "free settling" or "single particle settling". However, when the particles are near each other (in the form of a slurry), the motion of one particle is greatly influenced by the presence of other particles. This process is called "hindered settling". Particle settling occurs when the gravity vector is greater than the forces contributing to particle suspension. However, the forces that contribute to particle suspension decrease as the fluid moves through surface equipment and downhole through tubing at high shear rates. The reduction in suspending ability occurs as the result of the thermal and shear history effects experienced by the fluid. Within the fractures, the gravity vector becomes dominant and particle settling begins to occur. The build up of settled particles along the bottom of the fracture causes a restriction to flow. As a result of settling, the area open to flow above the bed reduces and therefore, fluid velocity increases across the top of the sand dune. This makes the fluid, again, capable of re-suspending and moving the proppant while proppant deposition stops. This stage is called bed height equilibrium. It is important to note that at equilibrium conditions, fluid is capable of re-suspending and transporting proppant at the same rate that proppant settles. The settling rate, therefore, equals the transport rate and hence equilibrium occurs. Particle settling is an important issue in hydraulic fracturing because the expected improvement in productivity of a well after hydraulic fracturing depends mainly on the fracture length and fracture conductivity, both of which depend on proppant settling. The complexity of measuring proppant settling in multi-particle environment has been simplified by measuring single particle settling velocity. Measurement of single particle settling velocities in Newtonian fluids is simple and straightforward. This is due to the properties of these fluids, which state that viscosity is independent of shear rate.},

  abstract = {Abstract Prediction of proppant transport is important in both treatment design and post-treatment analysis. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in proppant transport as evidenced by the number of papers presented at SPE meetings. There are a number of factors that have been overlooked in these papers that we believe are of primary importance. This paper summarizes the work that has been done in the area of proppant transport in settling and non-settling fluids. We also present the results of analyzing convection in turbulent flow fracturing treatments. Introduction Since proppants were first used in hydraulic fracturing, the question of proppant placement in the fracture has remained, for the most part, unanswered. Prediction of proppant placement is important in fracturing treatment design and post treatment analysis and research work reported over the years has contributed greatly to our understanding of the proppant transport process. In this paper we will cover the major modes of transport and discuss the influence of fracture geometry on proppant placement. The Transport Process Thinking about proppant placement has been strongly influenced by assumptions made about fracture geometry. Early theoretical work on fracture geometry yielded a picture of fractures that were elliptical from top-to-bottom or end-to-end with a relatively well-bounded top and bottom. This led to a view of fractures with parallel or nearly parallel sides and a rectangular shape. Experimental proppant transport models were and still are, for the most part, based on these ideas. In many ways, it is the only practical approach to model building. As we will see, it can lead to rather naive view of the placement process. The taxonomy of proppant transport starts with a division of the process into two major groups based on fluid properties: non-crosslinked fluids where particle settling can be important and crosslinked fluids where it is not. Early proppant transport studies were primarily concerned with fluids in which it was thought that settling strongly influenced proppant placement. As in other areas of fracturing, work done by Perkin and Kern1 laid the groundwork for understanding proppant transport in non-crosslinked fluids and served as a basis for a number of later experimental models. The accepted view of proppant transport in fluids in which particle settling occurs at a significant rate is that settling is governed by Stokes type particle settling velocity, proppant concentration, and the fluid velocity in the fracture. Particles enter the fracture and are transported uniformly away from the entry point until they are deposited on the bottom of the fracture. Deposition results in the buildup in a bank of proppant that is limited in height by the velocity of the fluid across the top of the bank. Because the proppant bank is the most prominent feature of proppant transport by non-crosslinked fluids, these fluids are often referred to as ``bank-building fluids.'' With crosslinked fluids, settling is not an issue. The proppant goes with the fluid. And thus, there are two distinct general transport mechanisms. We will begin with crosslinked fluids because transport in these systems is, in many ways, simpler. Crosslinked Fluids In transport by crosslinked or non-crosslinked fluids, the first thing to remember is — nature is lazy. The fluids will always take the easiest route through the fracture. And with crosslinked fluids, the proppant goes where the fluid goes. There are two distinct wellbore configurations that have an influence on the final proppant distribution. If the perforated interval is short relative to the fracture height, flow into the fracture can be considered to be flow from a point source. While a more even distribution of perforations relative to the fracture height will provide a more uniform slurry distribution from top to bottom. Depending upon the number and location of perforations that actually accept fluid, local point source flows can be expected to influence the proppant distribution.},

Thisconfiguration allows both pressure taps at 1-ft [0.3-m] intervals. Thisconfiguration allows both qualitative visual observations and quantitativedensity measurements for calculation of proppant concentrations and settlingvelocities. We examined uncrosslinked hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) andhydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) fluids, as well as crosslinked guar, HPG, andcarboxymethyl HPG (CMHPG) systems. Sand loadings of 2 to 15 lbm/gal [240 to1797 kg/m3] (8 to 40 vol\% of solids) were tested. Experimental results werecompared with the predictions of existing particle-settling models for a40-lbm/1,000-gal predictions of existing particle-settling models for a40-lbm/1,000-gal [4.8-kg/m3] HPG fluid system. Introduction The problem of particle or proppant settling in hydraulic fracturingoperations is of great importance. Knowledge of proppant-settling velocity isnecessary for prediction of the proppant-settling velocity is necessary forprediction of the final proppant distribution in the fracture. A thoroughunderstanding of proppant transport aids in designing fracturing treatments toobtain more effective proppant distribution. During a hydraulic fracturingprocess, some fluid is lost to the formation, thus increasing the proppantconcentration of the slurry pumped. Proppant settling in slurries is a verycomplex phenomenon compared with single-particle settling in a fluid.phenomenon compared with single-particle settling in a fluid. Single-particlesettling in a non-Newtonian fluid in the fracture has been studied extensively.In contrast, very little literature exists that explains the complexhindered-settling effects of particles in non-Newtonian fracturing gels.Without adequate particles in non-Newtonian fracturing gels. Without adequatetheory for description of this phenomenon, most fracturing-design simulatorstoday use correlations for single-particle-settling velocities in fracturinggels, and from the theory of Newtonian suspensions or slurries, correct thesevelocities to account for the hindered settling effects. For example, from hisexperimental work with water and 35-cp [35-mPa] oil, Novotny suggested usingRichardson and Zaki's Newtonian-fluid correlations. Novotny demonstrated fromlimited experimental data that the correction for Newtonian-fluid hindranceeffects was also reasonably good for non-Newtonian fracturing gels. Novotnyalso reported that in some cases proppants agglomerated or clustered duringmeasurements of settling velocities of proppant-laden slurries flowing throughfractures. Kirkby and Rockefeller conducted static sedimentation experiments toevaluate the settling behavior of nonflowing slurries with thedifferential-pressure technique for measuring proppant concentration andsettling velocity in concentrated slurries. A proppant clustering phenomenonoccurs in all fracturing gels at proppant clustering phenomenon occurs in allfracturing gels at typical proppant concentrations, resulting in average staticslurry-settling velocities that are considerably greater than those of singleparticles. Dunand and Soucemarianadin used viscometric measurements to studysedimentation of single particles and suspensions in static HPG fracturingfluids. They showed that the viscosity function of these fluids can bepresented by the Ellis model and that theoretical predictions andexperimentally measured velocities of single particles agree well. Using gammaray attenuation measurements, Dunand and Soucemarianadin studied the settlingbehavior of concentrated proppant suspensions. They claimed that, in fluidswith identical single particle-settling velocities, the average settling rateof a concentrated suspension in a static non-Newtonian fluid is two to threetimes higher than in a corresponding Newtonian fluid. These two studies triedto answer some of the questions related to proppant settling in fracturing gelsin a multiparticle environment. Despite the contributions of these and otherauthors, however, further investigation is needed to understand this complexphenomenon fully. Therefore, an experimental study was undertaketo phenomenonfully. Therefore, an experimental study was undertaketo explain the complexphenomenon of particle settling in fracturing slurries. The objectives of thisinvestigation are two-fold: (1) to design and build a large-scale testingapparatus for simulating the behavior of proppant-laden fluids in a fractureand (2) to report observations of proppant settling in the presence of multipleparticles in controlled test conditions. Preliminary findings of particles incontrolled test conditions. Preliminary findings of sedimentation experimentswith various fluid systems also are reported.

  abstract = {Abstract Stimulated reservoir volume fracturing, in unconventional gas and tight oil development, is a key technology. Injecting low viscosity sand-laden fluid of high flow rate, it can form complex fracture networks. Therefore, placement of proppant deep into the complex fracture networks brings a conductive path for production enhancement and reduces flowing resistance when fluid flowing form rock matrix to wellbore. At current, it is still unclear that sand features of low viscosity sand-laden fluid of high flow rate, and especially for proppant transport in subsidiary fractures are also not clearly understand. In this study, we fully think about the practical condition of engineering. Thus, in terms of similarity criterion of geometry and Reynolds number, we build a large scale of proppant placement in visualization complex fracture networks device which can changes angles of fractures, width of fractures and numbers of fractures. Due to the single factors experiment, this paper will discuss a series tests to evaluate proppants transport in complex fracture networks. Different slick water treatment tests are simulated by pumping sand slurry through the visualization complex fracture networks device while varying parameters of perforation, angles of fractures, proppant size, pump rate and proppant concentration. From the experiment, treatment tests which are used in variable factors can obtain different laws about traction carpet feature, traction carpet areas, balance hight and balance time in complex fracture networks. This paper also describes a 3-D physical model. This model is designed by SolidWorks software and using grid software to make complex fracture grids. Afterwards, using fluent software to simulate proppant concentration distribution field in the model of complex fracture networks. In addition, comparing the results between physical model and numerical model, the results can reveal, during the process of SRV, the law of proppant placement in complex fracture networks and serve as guidelines for engineering design.},

Model parameters, such as annulus-friction factor, cuttings-deposition rate, and re-entrainment rate, were determined from numerous experiments previously performed by use of a large-scale cuttings-transport flow-loop apparatus. This apparatus simulates the complex flows in borehole annuli at various inclination angles, ranging from vertical to horizontal. In this study, the authors validate the model and analyze the cuttings transport by use of field data in a directional well, in which the annular ECD was measured by logging while drilling (LWD), and the rate of the returned cuttings was measured at the surface. On the basis of the simulation study, the potential of the developed transient-cuttings-transport simulator for the predrilling-and post-drilling-phase analyses is discussed. Moreover, the authors evaluate the transient-hole-cleaning conditions and the ECD behavior from the LWD data.},

  abstract = {Abstract
A nonlinear rheological model which accounts for the time-dependent elastic, viscous and yielding phenomena is developed in order to describe the flow behavior of thixotropic materials which exhibit yield stress. A key feature of the formulation is a smooth transition from an ‘elastically’ dominated response to a ‘viscous’ response without a discontinuity in the stress–strain curve. The model is phenomenological and is based on the kinetic processes responsible for structural changes within the thixotropic material. As such, it can predict thixotropic effects, such as stress overshoot during start-up of a steady shear flow and stress relaxation after cessation of flow. Thus this model extends a previously proposed viscoplastic model [J. Rheol. 34 (1991) 647] to include thixotropy. An analysis and comparison to experimental data involving oscillatory shear flow are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the model and to estimate the model parameters in a prototype concentrated suspension. The experiments were conducted using a series of concentrated suspensions of silicon particles and silicon carbide whiskers in polyethylene. The data obtained with this experimental system indicated much better agreement between the theory and experiments that obtained in earlier work.},

We measure the sedimenting velocity of rigid spheres in power-law fluids. By imposing a controlled rotation, we can increase the typical shear rate in the surrounding fluid leading to a decrease of the effective fluid viscosity and, consequently, an increase of the sedimentation speed of the spheres. By fitting our experimental measurements to a power-law dependence of the sedimentation speed on the rotation frequency we are able to predict the values of the consistency and power indices for the test fluids. This setup could thus be used as a rheometer for power-law fluids.},

  abstract = {The multiple forms of cathepsin A (AI, AII, and AIII) purified from the lysosome fraction of rat liver by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex chromatographies were studied comparatively. Forms AI, AII and AIII were stable between pH 3.0 and 5.5, and had pH optima for CBZ-Glu-Phe at 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9, respectively. These activities were rapidly lost on heating above 60 degrees. Their isoelectric points were at 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9, and the Michaelis constants for CBZ-Glu-Phe were calculated as 10, 6.6, and 4.2 X 10(-4)M, respectively. Activity was inhibited by Ag+, Au3+, Hg2+, iodine, and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), toluenesuffonyl fluoride (TSF), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were inhibitory at a concentration of 10(-3)M. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition. No distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively). In immuno-diffusion analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA, dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern. After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line. This suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces. This conclusion is supported by results obtained by poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS.},

  abstract = {A nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system has been demonstrated in the guinea pig trachea. Electrical field stimulation of this system, in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine. The relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin, which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation. The gastrointestinal tract, which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract, also has a nonadrenergic inhibitory system. In the gastrointestinal tract, this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis, and absence of this system, in the colon and the rectum, is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in Hirschsprung's disease. It is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory nonadrenergic inhibitory system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreactive airways in asthma. The airways, due to a lack of inhibition, may be either partially contracted or unable to relax, and thus appear hyperreactive to stimuli.},

  abstract = {Wall slip is an important phenomenon for the flow of granular materials in chutes and channels. The appearance of a slip velocity at the wall critically affects wall stresses and flow profiles, and particularly the total flowrate. In this work we show, through numerical simulations and experiments, that the global slip phenomenon at a wall has peculiar features which deviate significantly from simple sliding behavior. At first we present experimental data for the vertical chute flow which highlight that wall slip depends on many operating and system variables such as flow rate, material properties, wall properties. Secondly, we resume a large campaign of numerical data performed in 2D with polygonal particles, and try to analyse the effect of material properties, contact parameters, operating variables, different flow configurations, on the slip phenomenon. The numerical campaign allowed to identify the main parameters affecting the wall slip behavior of a numerical model of granular flow, providing the ingredients for the creation of a framework for the description of wall slip.},

  doi = {10.1017/S0022112087000570},
  abstract = {Within a granular material stress is transmitted by forces exerted at points of mutual contact between particles. When the particles are close together and deformation of the assembly is slow, contacts are sustained for long times, and these forces consist of normal reactions and the associated tangential forces due to friction. When the particles are widely spaced and deformation is rapid, on the other hand, contacts are brief and may be regarded as collisions, during which momentum is transferred. While constitutive relations are available which model both these situations, in many cases the average contact times lie between the two extremes. The purpose of the present work is to propose constitutive relations and boundary conditions for this intermediate case and to solve the corresponding equations of motion for plane shear of a cohesionless granular material between infinite horizontal plates. It is shown that, in general, not all the material between the plates participates in shearing, and the solutions for the shearing material are coupled to a yield condition for the non-shearing material to give a complete solution of the problem.},

  title = {An Overview of Flow Regimes Describing Slurry Transport},
  abstract = {In dredging, the hydraulic transport of solids is one of the most important processes. Since the 50's many researchers have tried to create a physical mathematical model in order to predict the head losses in slurry transport. We can think of the models of Durand, Condolios, Gibert, Worster, Zandi \& Govatos, Jufin Lopatin, Fuhrboter, Newitt, Doron, Wilson, Matousek and Turian \& Yuan. Some models are based on phenomenological relations and thus result in semi empirical relations, others tried to create models based on physics, like the two and three layer models. It is however the question whether slurry transport can be modeled this way at all. Observations in our laboratory show a process which is often non-stationary with respect to time and space. Different physics occur depending on the line speed, particle diameter, concentration and pipe diameter. These physics are often named flow regimes; fixed bed, shearing bed, sliding bed, heterogeneous transport and (pseudo) homogeneous transport. It is also possible that more regimes occur at the same time, like, a fixed bed in the bottom layer with heterogeneous transport in the top layer. It is the observation of the authors that researchers often focus on a detail and sub-optimize their model, which results in a model that can only be applied for the parameters used for their experiments. At high line speeds the volumetric spatial concentration (volume based) and the volumetric transport concentration (volume flux based) are almost equal, because all the particles are in suspension with a small slip related to the carrier fluid velocity. The difference of the head loss between the two concentrations will be within the margin of the scatter of the experiments. At low line speeds however, there may be a sliding or fixed bed, resulting in a big difference between the two concentrations and thus between laboratory and real life situations. This paper describes 9 flow regimes and 6 possible scenarios. The flow regimes for constant C vs are; 1: fixed bed without suspension, 2: fixed bed with suspension, 3: sliding bed with suspension, 5: heterogeneous, 6: (pseudo) homogeneous, 7: homogeneous and 8: sheet flow. The flow regimes for constant C vt are; 4: sliding bed with suspension, 2: fixed bed with suspension, , 5: heterogeneous, 6: (pseudo) homogeneous, 7: homogeneous and 8: sheet flow. 3 scenarios are based on a constant volumetric spatial concentration (usually in a laboratory) and 3 scenarios are based on a constant volumetric transport concentration (usually in real life). The flow regimes and scenarios are explained and examples of experiments are given. Based on the experimental evidence, one can conclude that the approach followed in this paper gives a good resemblance with the reality.},

  doi = {10.1098/rspa.1973.0038},
  abstract = {Owing to observational difficulties the distinction between a ‘suspended’ load of solids transported by a stream and a ‘ bed-load ’ has long remained undefined. Recently, however, certain critical experiments have thrown much light on the nature of bed-load transport. In particular, it has been shown that bed-load transport, by saltation, occurs in the absence of fluid turbulence and must therefore be due to a separate dynamic process from that of transport in suspension by the internal eddy motion of a turbulent fluid. It has been further shown that the forward motion of saltating solids is opposed by a frictional force of the same order as the immersed weight of the solids, the friction coefficient approximating to that given by the angle of slip. The maintenance of steady motion therefore requires a predictable rate of energy dissipation by the transporting fluid. The fluid thrust necessary to maintain the motion is shown to be exerted by virtue of a mean slip velocity which is predictable in the same way as, and approxim ates to, the terminal fall velocity of the solid. The mean thrust, and therefore the transport rate of saltating solids, are therefore predictable in terms of the fluid velocity close to the bed, at a distance from it, within the saltation zone, of a ‘centre of fluid thrust’ analogous to the ‘centre of pressure’. This velocity, which is not directly measurable in water streams, can be got from a knowledge of stream depth and mean flow velocity. Thus a basic energy equation is obtained relating the rate of transporting work done to available fluid transporting power. This is shown to be applicable to the transport both of wind-blown sand, and of water-driven solids of all sizes and larger than that of medium sand. Though the mean flow velocity is itself unpredictable, the total stream power, which is the product of this quantity times the bed shear stress, is readily measurable. But since the mean flow velocity is an increasing function of flow depth, the transport of solids expressed in terms of total stream power must decrease with increasing flow depth/grain size ratio. This considerable variation with flow depth has not been previously recognised. It explains the gross inconsistencies found in the existing experimental data. The theoretical variation is shown to approximate very closely to that found in recent critical experiments in which transport rates were measured at different constant flow depths. The theory, which is largely confirmed by these and other earlier experiments, indicates that suspension by fluid turbulence of mineral solids larger than those of medium sands does not become appreciable until the bed shear stress is increased to a value exceeding 12 times its threshold value for the bed material considered. This range of unsuspended transport decreases rapidly, however, as the grain size is reduced till, at a certain critical size, suspension should occur at the threshold of bed movement.},

  abstract = {This paper reports measurements of the rheology of a range of water-based drilling muds at temperatures up to 130 deg. C and pressures up to 1000 bar. The fluids are highly thixotropic; pressures up to 1000 bar. The fluids are highly thixotropic; decoupling of temperature/pressure effects from those due to time-dependent structural changes was achieved by developing a sample preparation and handling procedure which ensures that all samples experience identical shear histories prior to study in the rheometer. This enabled essentially equilibrium flow curves to be determined over a shear rate range of 0 - 1200 s-1 with a reproducibility of better than +/-1 Pa in stress.

The data were best fitted using a three parameter Herschel-Bulkley yield/power-law model although in many cases, particularly at low temperatures and high pressures, the two particularly at low temperatures and high pressures, the two parameter Casson equation gave an acceptable fit for parameter Casson equation gave an acceptable fit for engineering purposes. For both models the behaviour of the highshear viscosity reflected the viscous behaviour of the continuous phase: a weak pressure dependence and an exponential temperature dependence matching that of water. The pressure dependence increased with mud density. In all cases the pressure dependence increased with mud density. In all cases the fluid yield stress was essentially independent of pressure. In contrast to oil-based muds, where this quantity decreases with temperature, for these water-based systems it remained constant below some characteristic temperature, whereafter it increased exponentially with inverse temperature.

The physical origins of the observed behaviour are discussed and a simple model for representing the data is given. It is shown how this may be used for reliable extrapolation of surface measurements to downhole conditions for well-circulated water-based muds.},

  title = {Measurements of Critical Shear Stress for Entraining Fine Sediments in a Boundary Layer},
  url = {https://authors.library.caltech.edu/25978/1/KH_R_7.pdf},
  abstract = {Experiments were made in a flume 15-3 18 in. wide by 12 ft long to
determine the shear stress for critical motion of fine sediment in a growing
boundary layer. Determinations were made for two sediments, a quartz
sand with geometric mean sieve size of 0. 102 mm and glass beads with
geometric mean sedimentation diameter of 0. 037 mm.
The intensity of sediment motion was judged from the frequency of
bursts of motion over a small area varying from 7 to 18 mm in diameter.
When the burst frequency fell between 113 and 1 burst per second, critical
conditions for inception of motion were considered to obtain.
Values of shear velocity, u*, and bed shear stress, 7 for turbulent
0,
flow were determined from measured velocity profile data by essentially two
methods. In the first the slope, N, of a straight line fitted to a semilogarithmic
graph of velocity profile data was used in Eq. (8) to obtain u:::.
In the other, values of point velocity, u, at a distance of .03 ft from the
bed was substituted into the logarithmic equation for velocity distribution
at a smooth wall, Eq. (5), to obtain u,\$. The data obtained from Eq. (8)
and plotted on Fig. 14a show wider scatter than those calculated from
Eq. (5) and plotted on Fig. 14b. The data obtained by means of Eq. (5) are
considered the more reliable and are presented on a complete Shields
diagram in Fig. 15.},

Research is needed to further understand and be able to predict the flow behavior of such materials and to investigate ways of improving their processing. The Non-Newtonian Solid-Liquid fluid flow behavior in horizontal and vertical pipes can be predicted by various methods which are mention in the paper. In the literature, it is also shows that Computational Fluid dyanamices (CFD) has sufficient capability to deal with such type of flow and was capable of giving predictions of pressure drop which were probably better and more reliable than the correlations available in the literature.},

  title = {Study of Cuttings Transport Using Water-Based and Oil-Based Drilling Fluids},
  abstract = {Cuttings transport is a topic of great interest in the oil and gas drilling industry. Insufficient cuttings transport leads to several expensive problems. Knowledge and selection of the drilling fluids is one of the important factor for efficient hole cleaning. The present work reports pure hydraulic and cutting transport behavior of various oil-based and water-based drilling fluids. Flow loop experiments were conducted on a purpose built flow loop close to realistic field conditions.
It has been observed, however, that the hole cleaning performance of drilling fluids can be different even if the fluid rheological properties are similar as measured in accordance with API specifications. The reasons for stated difference in the behavior of drilling fluids are not well understood. The objective of the present work was to compare hole cleaning performance of an oil-based drilling fluid and a water-based drilling fluid with similar density and viscosity measured as per API specifications. Also, to identify the reasons for differences in their hole cleaning behaviour. Limited studies are available in the literature which studied the same and conclusions differ.
Hole cleaning efficiency of an oil-based drilling fluid and a water-based drilling fluid whose viscosity profiles are similar was investigated. The fluids tested were industrial fluids used in the field and were sent to us after reconditioning. Experimental studies were performed on an advanced purpose-built flow-loop by varying flow velocities and drill string rotation rates. The flow loop had a 10 m long annulus section with 4" inner diameter wellbore and 2" outer diameter fully eccentric drill string. Pressure drop and sand holdup measurements were reported. Rheological investigations of the same fluids were used to understand the difference in the behavior of the drilling fluids tested. In case of no drill string rotation, better hole cleaning performance was observed with the oil-based fluid compared to the water-based fluid. With the presence of drill string rotation, hole cleaning performance of both the fluids was nearly the same.},

  abstract = {In oil and gas drilling, cuttings transport related problems are a major contributor to well downtime and costs. As a result, solutions to these problems have been extensively researched over the years, both experimentally and through simulation. Numerous review articles exist, summarizing not only the research history but also the qualitative effect of individual case parameters such as e.g. pump flow rate, pipe rotation, and rate of penetration on cuttings transport. However, comparing different studies is challenging, because there is no common reference defined in the form of a typical and representative set of case parameters.
To develop relevant and accurate cutting transport models, it is critical that both experiments and models are targeting flow cases relevant for respective drilling operations. Development of a clear understanding of the industrial parameter space, as well as establishing benchmarks, will help achieve a more concerted effort in development of models and corresponding laboratory experiments.
Other industries have established research benchmarks, such as the “NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine” (Jonkman et al. 2009) in wind power research, providing a standardized set of case parameters and profiles, readily available for use to researchers worldwide, and resulting in straightforward benchmarking and validation as well as faster establishing of projects.
For application to modeling of cuttings transport phenomena, we propose a methodology for deriving a well-defined and standardized set of geometrical, operational, and environmental case parameters describing various operating points of drilling operations and procedures as well as simplified problems. The methodology is exemplified with an 8.5 in. section drilling ahead use-case using aggregated wellbore data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The relevance and application of the derived parameters is briefly discussed in the light of modeling, both experimentally and through simulations. Applying this methodology prior to any cuttings transport study may enable a better definition of industry-relevant case parameters.
In Part 2, we will apply and discuss the derived parameter sets in the context of non-dimensional numbers for assessment of scaleability.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent pipe flow of a Generalised Newtonian (GN) fluid at Re τ = 323 are analysed to identify the region where GN rheology has the major influence. The flow domain is divided into two parts: in y + $<$ y + up and y + $>$ y + up , with the viscosity modelled using a power-law rheology for y + $<$ y + up and a uniform viscosity for y + $>$ y + up. Values for y + up of 35 and 70 are considered. Results show that beyond y + = 70, the GN rheology has no significant effect on the mean flow or turbulence statistics, and that the effect of GN rheology is confined to the near wall. To understand these results , the turbulent kinetic energy budget of the GN fluid and a Newtonian fluid at the same Re τ = 323 are compared. The comparison shows that the GN viscosity-dependent terms in the balance either vanish or do not show rheology dependence beyond y + = 70. The current results imply that in Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes and Large eddy simulations the GN rheology's effects can be taken care of by modifying the wall functions.},

The relation between gas pressure gradient and the flow rates of the two phases is predicted, over the whole range of cocurrent and countercurrent flows, together with velocity profiles for both phases and the radial concentration profile for the particles. The gas and the particles interact through a drag force depending on their relative velocity, and there are mutual interactions between pairs of particles through inelastic collisions. This model is shown to account for marked segregation of gas and particles in the radial direction, and the predicted relation between the pressure gradient and the flow rates of the two phases is surprisingly complex.},

Measurements of particle pressure using a differential transducer and granular temperature with a digital camera as a function of bulk density, determined using an X-ray densitometer, showed that a relation exists among pressure, temperature, and density, analogous to the ideal gas law. In the limit of zero solids volume fraction: (Solid Pressure)/[(Granular Temperature) × (Bulk Density)] = 1.0. Measurements of radial distribution functions using the digital camera showed that their peak values occur at particle contact and lie between the predictions from the Bagnold equation and Carnahan–Starling equation. The hard sphere model was corrected for a cohesive pressure using the minimum in the measured radial distribution function. The new model agrees with the pressure measurements in the dense regime.},

A three dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model using volume of fluid (VOF) method is presented for predicting the development of phase distribution using OpenFOAM. For a gas-liquid two-phase flow, the interface changes its position with respect to time and space. The movement of interface in turn influences the flow field. Various two-phase flow regimes are thus observed as the flow parameters of the two phases are varied. The phenomena of bubble coalescence, growth and breakup, and the mass, momentum and energy exchange between the two phases add up to the numerical complexities towards capturing these flow patterns using CFD models. A numerical simulation is carried out to study the transition to slug flow from the stratified flow and the development of slug, plug and annular flow.},

  abstract = {The handling of solid-liquid suspensions is an important concern within the chemical and processing industries and many theoretical models have been proposed to try and explain and predict turbulent flow behaviour. However, the prediction of turbulent flow from only the viscous properties of non-Newtonian suspensions has over the years been questioned by researchers. This thesis considers theoretical models well established in the literature and the Slatter model, which uses both the rheology of the suspension and the particle size distribution of the solids. These models are used to analyze the experimental data and the effect that particle size and the particle size distribution has on turbulent flow behaviour. The literature concerning the rheological fundamentals relevant to fluid flow in pipes has been examined. The Newtonian turbulent flow model as well as the non-Newtonian models of Dodge \& Metzner, Torrance, Kemblowski \& Kolodziejski, Wilson \& Thomas and Slatter have been reviewed. Test work was conducted at the University of Cape Town's Hydrotransport Research Laboratory using a pumped recirculating pipe test rig. The test apparatus has been fully described and calibration and test procedures to enable collecting of accurate pipeline data have been presented. Three slurries were used in test work namely kaolin clay, mixture I (kaolin clay and rock flour) and mixture 2 (kaolin clay, rock flour and sand) with ad,s particle size ranging from 24/Lm to 170/Lm. The yield pseudoplastic model has been used to model and predict the laminar flow of the suspensions that were tested and the method adopted by Neill (1988) has been used to determine the rheological constants. The pipeline test results have been presented as pseudo-shear diagrams together with the theoretical model lines providing a visual appraisal of the performance of each model. The Slatter model predicts the test data best with the other theoretical models that were considered tending to under predict the head loss. The reason the Slatter model performs better than the other theoretical models is because this model can account for the wall roughness and particle roughness effect. Evidence to support this statement has been presented. This thesis highlights the fact that the particle size distribution is a vitally important property of the suspension and that it does influence turbulent flow behaviour. It shows that turbulence modelling using the particle roughness effect (eg Slatter, 1994) is valid and can be adopted for non-Newtonian slurries. It is concluded that the particle size distribution must be used to determine the particle roughness effect and this effect must be incorporated in the turbulent flow analysis of non-Newtonian slurries.},

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {Settling velocities of cuttings particles in drilling fluid (“mud”) is one of the most important parameters for the efficiency of drilling long deviated wells. Numerical simulators have been developed worldwide to assist the optimization of cuttings transport. Models for particle settling velocities to enter these simulators are based on experimental conditions which not always reflect the situation they are used for in industrial processes.
Effects which modify and disturb settling velocities are drillstring movement, liquid convection and turbulence, cuttings particles size and shape, particle-particle interaction, and - most important - the drilling mud rheology and composition. This also includes oil-water dispersions and also free gas in the mud.
The experimental work of this paper has been developed to a large extent in connection with a Master thesis1 at the University of Stavanger. The motivation for the study was to determine the impact of flow regimes on settling modes and falling velocities.
In the present paper the main focus is on theoretical aspects and analysis methods involved. More results from the laboratory tests will be described in the presentation for the NRS 2014 Conference.
Laboratory experiments using high speed video recordings were used to reveal some of these effects. As might be expected, the settling flow regimes and are quite different for Newtonian versus non-Newtonian liquids. Finally, we describe image analysis assisted determination of fall speeds},

This paper continues those conversations with a discussion into some of the basic mechanisms that can be employed to understand the quality of data received in real-time. It will expand on the ideas around how this can be implemented generically in a real-time operational support system and the benefits of such a system that can be deployed regardless of the process or naming conventions used by at the original point of acquisition. This paper will explore some of the available ways to monitor and measure the quality of real-time data as well as the practical value of understanding each of these measurement’s validity. It will also touch on a few of the benefits that the end-consumers will see in having a standardized mechanism of determining the quality of the data they are using in calculations, monitoring and reporting. This road to data quality however has several limitations when only using open standards such as WITSML, therefore we will explore the options that are available as well as a few of the practical limitations imposed by these standards.},

Previous investigators used unrealistically high fluid velocities and/or short test sections where steady-state conditions had not been established. This study used a 40-ft [12.2-m] test section. Pipe rotation and eccentricity, as well as several types of drilling muds and flow regimes, were studied. Annulus angles varied from 0 to 90°, and actual drilled cuttings were used. The major factors affecting cuttings transport are drilling fluid velocity, hole inclination, and fluid rheological properties. Much higher annular velocities are required for effective hole cleaning in directional wells than in vertical wells. An increase in hole angle and/or drilling rate reduces the transport performance of drilling fluids. Hole angles of 40 to 50° are critical because of cuttings buildup and downward sliding of the bed of cuttings. High-viscosity muds were observed to provide better transport than low-viscosity muds.},

Fluids with equal density, viscosity and gel strength according to these criteria still perform differently, especially regarding hole cleaning efficiency. To investigate this discrepancy, two water based fluids, a bentonite and a KCl/polymer based fluid, with identical properties according to API-13I, was studied. A detailed rheological exmination showed that the bentonite fluid has a strong gel-like character and good long-term storage capabilities, while the KCl/polymer fluid has shorter regeneration time following shear stress. We here show how a thorough rheological analyzis can add a valuable supplement to API standard tests.},

  url = {http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/7693},
  abstract = {Turbulence is present everywhere in our environment yet its complexities remain one of the great challenges in scientific and engineering research. This work began out of personal interest. As such, it involved all aspects of my background, not just my engineering training. It is disconcerting to some westerners to think of scientists as philosophers. In the traditional Vietnamese culture, it is not possible to think of scientists as not being philosophers. In the old days we taught philosophy before we gave more practical training because all that we do IS influenced by our beliefs. I was educated in French schools and New Zealand universities while being raised in a strongly nationalistic culture. This bicultural upbringing led at some stages of my youth to a painful crisis of identity but it greatly enriched my life and coloured my approach to science. The reader will find the influences of this background in my ideas about turbulence. At one time, the West used to think of Asian beliefs as vague. I was first taught by an extraordinary Vietnamese electrical engineer that our description of the universe was in fact a binary progression. This is found in the Kinh Dich (in Chinese Yi-King, the Book of Change). This concept is not specific to the Vietnamese or Chinese cultures. It can be found in Indian thought, in Islamic Kybalion (their secret book), in Egyptian and South American cultures. Since that day, I have learned much more about traditional Vietnamese culture which is unconsciously reflected in some of the ideas I have developed in this research. We believe that all phenomena are periodic. The manifestations that look continuous may in fact be thought of as an endless repetition of events that regenerate constantly. They are not static. I was not unduly surprised to learn of Fourier analysis which decomposes a continuous function into a series of periodic elements. I was thus receptive to the idea that one can define a timescale even for laminar flow, when I found it. It became eventually a transformation between the penetration and boundary layer theories of heat and mass transfer (Appendix A4). We also believe, for example, that all things in Creation are governed by the same fundamental laws. In oriental medicine, it allowed us to understand and cure the human body by observing the laws that govern the larger universe. In essence, the organisation of the solar system is paralleled by that of the human body: there is a correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm. The reader will find a reflection of that thought in Chapter 9 where I endeavour to compare the information contained in time-averaged measurements to the those obtained from transient contributions. We believe that, like us, the Earth breathes. In the teaching of Khi Cong (the equivalent of Yoga) which I studied briefly, it is important to take note of and keep in harmony with this natural cycle since we derive so many of our resources from the Earth where we live. I have often wondered whether our environmental engineering would not have benefited if those ideas had permeated into Western science. To me, thoughts are not abstractions. They are concrete entities. We can now detect them through encephalograms. Thus thoughts that are conceived by a person are broad casted into the environment. If one is receptive, one can gather the wisdom of others around us. This is why Asian philosophy puts such an emphasis on emptying ourself of our own stray thoughts. This ultimate state of dispossession, mental as well as emotional and physical, is not easy to achieve because we tend to cling so hard to our own pre-conceived ideas. Vietnam can truly boast of having the most isolated scientific community in the world. The isolation imposed on the Vietnamese people by the Communists has forced many of us to face ourselves. In some cases it has been useful because this intellectual silence has made us much more receptive to the thoughts around us. In that sense, I have always felt that my work is simply the natural outcome of ideas evolved by my elders and colleagues in this field. In Phong Thuy (in Chinese Feng Shui, the art of shaping landscaping) the position where one buries one's ancestors is important because the configuration of the land filters the waves that are picked up by the remains of the deceased and transmitted to their descendants who are on the same wavelength. This is how innate talents are formed. As a people, the Vietnamese have had a wonderful ability to assimilate and adapt the culture of the peoples we meet, even those who tried to conquer us. The tragic history of our country during the last hundred years has unfortunately eroded the confidence of many among us. The unfortunate policies of the Communist government during the last seventeen years have hit particularly hard and we risk losing much of our fine heritage. It is particularly painful for me to see how many of my friends, some certainly brighter than I am, have given up on research because the facilities, if they exist at all, are so much poorer than anywhere else. In the later years, the driving force behind the present work was no longer pure interest but the need to show that, whatever the circumstances, our achievements are only restricted by our perseverance with the task at hand. The work became a statement of philosophy as much as one of engineering research. My hope is that my work will make a contribution to the field, that it will be recognised as such and in a small way help the Vietnamese nation find itself again.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new theory of turbulence in time-independent non-Newtonian fluids. The wall layer is modelled in terms of unsteady exchange of viscous momentum between the wall and the main stream, following the classic visualisation of inrush-sweep-ejection/burst. The thickness of the wall layer is found to be the same for Newtonian and purely viscous non-Newtonian fluids, when normalised with the instantaneous wall parameters at the onset of bursting. The results indicate that the mechanisms of turbulence in Newtonian and time-independent fluids are identical when structural similarity relations in turbulence are based on phase-locked parameters linked with the development of secondary flows rather than on time-averaged wall parameters. This similarity analysis collapses the local critical instantaneous friction factor data of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids at the point of bursting into a single curve. The method greatly simplifies the analysis of turbulent transport phenomena in non-Newtonian fluids. Keywords: Turbulence, time-independent non-Newtonian, Power law, pipe flow, wall layer},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple new closure principle for turbulent shear flows. The turbulent flow field is divided into an outer and an inner region. The inner region is made up of a log-law region and a wall layer. The wall layer is viewed in terms of the well known inrush-sweep-burst sequence observed since 1967. It is modelled as a transient laminar sub-boundary layer, which obeys the Stokes solution for an impulsively started flat plate. The wall layer may also be modelled with a steady state solution by adding a damping function to the log-law. Closure is achieved by matching the unsteady and steady state solutions at the edge of the wall layer. This procedure in effect feeds information about the transient coherent structures back into the time-averaged solution and determines theoretically the numerical coefficient of the logarithmic law of the wall The method gives a new technique for writing accurate wall functions, valid for all Reynolds numbers, in computer fluid dynamics (CFD) programmes.

A series of DNS on turbulent channel flow is performed for different rheological properties at two different Reynolds numbers. It is found that high drag reduction is achieved by suppressing the turbulent contribution for the high Weissenberg number, and/or by decreasing the viscosity ratio and the effective viscosity. A highly drag-reduced turbulent flow at a high Reynolds number is mainly caused by the viscoelastic effect in the elastic layer, where as the outer layer flow hardly affects the drag reduction. Moreover, we focus on the viscoelastic contribution term in the budget of Reynolds stress and its relation to the local flow pattern. It is shown that in the near-wall region of the highly drag-reduced flow a positive work done by viscoelastic stress is closely associated with vortex stretching that produces turbulent kinetic energy from stored elastic energy, whereas a negative one causes vortex compression.},

First we will show that the particle moves towards a wall if immersed in a non-Newtonian fluid under continuous shear flow, in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. Anyway most of the experiments are performed under oscillatory shear flow, so we will study the effect of oscillation on the migration of the particle and we will compare our results with experimental data. Finally we will report results of migration when particle is moving between two concentric rotating cylinders. We will show that the migration is strongly affected by the curvature of the two cylinders. We will also show the effect of the suspending fluid and the particle size.},

The correlations are based on extensive experimental data on the flow of concentrated slurries of laterite and gypsum through capillary tubes and also straight pipe test sections in a slurry pipeline flow facility. The capillary tube diameters ranged from 0.103 to 0.400 cm, and the test pipe diameters were 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 cm (standard 12, 1 and 2 in pipe). For laminar flow the friction factor-Reynolds number relationship appropriate to the three-parameter Sisko model was derived, as rheometric measurements had established that this empirical rheological model did the best job of describing the shear stress-shear rate dependence for the test slurries, at all concentrations, over the whole measured range of shear rates; from about 1 to 25,200 s-1. For the turbulent regime it is established that the Blasius, inverse (14)th power friction factor-Reynolds number form is appropriate, with Reynolds number defined in terms of the high-shear limiting viscosity ￼￼amp; and the density of the suspension. These friction loss correlations are significant because the Sisko model, which combines a lower shear power-law region with a high-shear Newtonian asymptote, coincides with the observed shear stress-shear rate behavior of most highly-loaded fine particulate slurries over precisely the range of shear appropriate to pipeline transport.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present two new numerical algorithms for updating the equations of motion for a viscoelastic fluid that can be described by the finite extensible nonlinear elastic polymer model with the closure proposed by Peterlin (so called FENE-P model) in a transient calculation. In particular, our algorithms address two difficulties found in earlier formulations. First, the polymer extension, represented by the trace of the conformation tensor, can numerically exceed the finite extensible length causing the restoring spring force to change sign and the calculation to rapidly diverge. In our formulations, we have redefined the conformation tensor so that this possibility no longer exists. Secondly, the conformation tensor must remain symmetric and positive definite at all times for the calculation to remain stable. The accumulation of numerical errors can cause loss of this property, leading to the growth of Hadamard instabilities [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 60 (1995) 53]. We present two matrix decompositions that enable us to construct the conformational tensor in a manner that ensures positive definiteness. Numerical tests of the new algorithms show significant departures from other approaches that rely on filtering to remove the instabilities.},

  doi = {10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000934.},
  abstract = {Pressure gradients were measured for shear-thinning (5\% CMC), Bingham plastic (7\% bentonite), and viscoplastic (6\% kaolin) fluids in pipe diameters of 40 to 200 mm, in laminar and turbulent flow. The fluids were characterized as power law, Bingham plastic, and Herschel-Bulkley fluids respectively, and additionally as Casson fluids. The study considered the effect of the rheological model in repro- ducing experimental laminar flow, and on transitional velocity and turbulent flow predictions. For the fluids tested, the model was found to have little effect on laminar flow calculations. Transitional velocities were predicted using three well-known techniques and found to depend on the model, although no preferences were apparent. Errors in transitional velocity predictions varied from 2.5 to 31\%. Turbulent predictions too were made using three common and widely published methods, and varied significantly with rheology. All the methods, however, predicted turbulent flow similarly when using the Casson model, with errors of between 4 and 11\%. It is concluded, at least for the types of time-independent, homogeneous/pseudohomogeneous, non-Newtonian fluids investigated, that for pipe flow in the practical range 40 s−1 $<$ ð8V=DÞ $<$ 1,000 s−1, laminar flow pressure gradient predictions are insensitive to the rheological model. Transitional velocity and turbulent flow pressure gradient predictions, however, are significantly affected by the rheological model used, so care must be taken to correctly characterize fluids for which these predictions are required.},

  url = {http://digitalknowledge.cput.ac.za:8081/xmlui/handle/11189/63},
  abstract = {Pipe roughness is known to greatly increase the turbulent flow friction factor for Newtonian fluids. The well-known Moody diagram shows that an order of magnitude increase in the friction is possible due to the effect of pipe roughness. However, since the classical work of Nikuradse (1926 -1933), very little has been done in this area. In particular, the effects that pipe roughness might have on non-Newtonian turbulent flow head loss, has been all but totally ignored. This thesis is directed at helping to alleviate this problem. An experimental investigation has been implemented in order to quantify the effect that pipe roughness has on non-Newtonian turbulent flow head loss predictions. The Balanced Beam Tube Viscometer(BBTV), developed at the University of Cape Town, has been rebuilt and refined at the Cape Technikon and is being used for research in this field. The BBTV has been fitted with pipes of varying roughness. The roughness of smooth PVC pipes was artificially altered using methods similar to those of Nikuradse. This has enabled the accumulation of flow data in laminar and turbulent flow in pipes that are both hydraulically smooth and rough. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids have been used for the tests. The data has been subjected to analysis using various theories and scaling laws. The strengths and problems associated with each approach are discussed and it is concluded that roughness does have a sigmficant effect on Newtonian as well as non-Newtonlan flow.},

This research shows these steps clearly to reach acceptable physical analytic solutions for calculating the friction factor and pipe diameter. Proposed true analytical solutions aim at reducing the computational time and effort and eliminate the need for iterative solutions. The propagation of errors for nonlinear systems should be accounted for when the intensive computation of the friction factor (e.g. in optimization problems) is required. Proposed solution of the friction factor will be a suitable computational tool for implementing these nonlinear models.},

mechanics. To achieve this, a detailed numerical study is carried out to investigate the effect of sudden
valve closure on the flow dynamics of power-law fluids in circular pipes. An unsteady two-dimensional
pipe flow model is employed which takes into consideration both fluid compressibility and pipe elasticity.
The present model is numerically integrated in time using the fourth-order accurate Runge–Kutta
method while spatial terms are discretized using second-order accurate central difference expressions.
Present results show that laminar pipe transients are significantly affected by the shear-thinning and
shear-thickening behavior of the non-Newtonian fluid. Reported unsteady velocity profiles during the
pipe transient show an excessive Richardson annular effect in the case of shear-thinning fluids, which
is reduced significantly in the case of shear-thickening fluids. Present results also show that the shearthickening
behavior leads to more rapid attenuation of the fluid transient. Moreover, shear-thickening
effects give rise to excessive pipeline packing which results in a pressure rise at the valve that could significantly
exceed the theoretical maximum predicted by the inviscid Joukowsky pressure rise.},

The effects of the different parameters were investigated in two differentmodes: the circulation mode, that involves the development of a cuttings bed orbuild-up of cuttings in the wellbore, and hole cleaning mode, which is cleaningout an existing cuttings bed. It will be shown that the results indicate: 1)for the tested particle size range (0.150 - 7 mm), cleaning efficiency ispartly dependant upon the particle's size, 2) with suitable agitation, a gelledfluid is more effective for cuttings transport than water in a highly deviatedwellbore, 3) Pipe eccentricity has an effect on cuttings transport fordifferent fluids and 4) for complete wellbore clean-up it requires many morehole volumes than previous 'rules of thumb' would indicate.},

  abstract = {In this general lecture, we shall first outline the way computational non-Newtonian fluid mechanics differs from conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We do this by briefly outlining the major historical developments in this relatively new field of science, which is conveniently called Computational Rheology. To illustrate essential features, we limit the discussion to the Oldroyd B, UCM and Phan-Thien/Tanner constitutive models. In order to provide a serious challenge to existing numerical codes, we describe some recent unpublished experimental results on flow through a contraction of constant viscosity (Boger) and also shear-thinning elastic liquids. Both planar and axisymmetric contractions are of interest, and pressure drops and observed flow structures provide the relevant points of contact between experiment and numerical prediction. Numerical codes developed at UWS involving a hybrid finite-element/finite-volume scheme for Oldroyd B and Phan-Thien/Tanner constitutive models are applied to the contraction-flow problems and an encouraging agreement is demonstrated between theory and experiment. Specifically, the dramatic experimental differences between flow in planar and axisymmetric contractions and between constant viscosity and shear-thinning polymer solutions are mirrored in the numerical predictions, at least in a qualitative sense. Notwithstanding these encouraging developments, the review ends with a realistic assessment of the challenges still awaiting computational rheologists, with particular reference to the choice of constitutive model and the possibility of further refinements to the numerical techniques.

  abstract = {A series of experiments was made in a closed rectangular conduit with bentonite as fine particles and plastic beads as coarse particles. Compared with that in clear water, in bentonite suspensions coarse particles settle more slowly and start moving at a higher flow intensity. Due to the larger threshold velocity and smaller settling velocity, the bed load is smaller and the suspended load is larger. As a result, the total load, consisting of the bed load and the suspended load, is smaller in the low flow intensity region, but larger in the high flow intensity region. The increase of the suspended load favors the tran- sition from dunes to plane bed. So in clay suspension dunes are lower, flatter, and change to plane bed at lower flow intensity. Correspondingly, the form resistance is smaller in clay suspension.},

  abstract = {The prediction of pressure losses is very important in many oil-field operations, including drilling, completion, fracturing, acidizing, workover and production. In this study, a utility hydraulic calculation method has been developed that requires as input the raw fluid rehological data and relevant hydraulic parameters. This new method is based on three important developments. First, this paper presents a new and powerful rheological model, named four-parameter model. A brief introduction was given to the determination of rheological parameters. Calculation model for rheological parameters was built based on regression method. Using a variety of data from literature, it is shown that four-parameter model could precise represent the rheogram of the time-independent fluids. Second, a generalized hydraulic calculation model is developed based on power law extension method, which is independent of the form of the rheological model of choice. For laminar flow, pressure drop formula is derived based on characteristic method of pipe flow. And turbulent pressure loss is calculated by semi-empirical formulas. Flow regime determination method is established by quoting generalized flow behavior index. Third, for pressure drop calculation precisely, the approach includes the additional pressure loss due to the effect of tool joints, accommodates drilling pipe rotation effects and accounts for the effects of annular eccentricity. Furthermore, simple, explicit and general formulations for approximation pressure losses over measurement while drilling tools are also presented to augment the suite of expression required for complex hydraulic calculation. The predictions of the developed method have been compared with several sets of experimental hydraulic data from different sources. The tested cases include laminar and turbulent flow of various drilling fluids in both pipe and annular geometry. The generalized hydraulic calculation model is shown to be quite accurate and superior to those obtained by the currently available standard techniques.Introduction Rheological characteristics and flowing law of non-Newtonian fluids are often encountered in the petroleum industry problems. The selection for constitutive equations and determination for rheological parameters are the basic elements for the research on non-Newtonian fluid, which is important for drilling optimization, hydraulic calculation and parameters optimization, etc. The standard API methods for drilling hydraulics assume either a Bingham plastic or power law rheological model, which were presented separately by Bingham (1916) and Ostwald (1925). Herschel \& Bulkley (1926) presented a yield power law model. Then, Zamora (1974), Cementing research section (1983) and Zhan (2000) published their papers to discuss the application of this model. Casson (1957) presented an improved model, which was discussed by Chen (1982), Zhong (1987) and Luo (1996), etc. Robertsion and Stiff (1976) presented a new model for drilling fluid and cement slurry. There were several papers published to discuss this model (Liu 1982, Huang 1982, etc). Bai (1980) presented a new hyperbolic model of yield-pseudoplastic fluids. After Sisko (1985) presented a new rheology model, Bailey \& Peden (1997, 2000) presented the hydraulic calculation procedures of this model. Pilehvari \& Serth (2001) introduced a rational polynomial model and the hydraulic calculation method. These models and the corresponding hydraulic calculations do provide a way for fair estimates of hydraulics for conventional wells using simple drilling fluids. However, nowadays, with many wells drilled deep, slim, or horizontal on shore and off shore using complex mud with unusual behavior, it is necessary to use more powerful rheological models and more rigorous calculation methods.},

In many cases, particle contaminants in an enclosed space are generated from an unsteady source. This investigation used the experimental data from two steady-state cases as well as one transient particle dispersion case in evaluating the performance of five (one steady and four transient) airflow models with the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods. The transient models obtained the mean flow and particle information by averaging them over time. For the models tested in this study, the Eulerian method performed similarly for all five airflow models. The Lagrangian method predicted incorrect particle concentrations with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) methods, but did well with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) models. For unsteady-state particle dispersion, the LES or DES models, along with the Lagrangian method, showed the best performance among all the models tested.},

  abstract = {Most calculations of particle deposition in turbulent boundary layers have been performed using an equation of motion in which the form for the lift force is that in a linear shear flow for a particle far from any boundaries, the so-called Saffman formula. Both direct and large eddy simulations of particle deposition in turbulent channel flow have shown that the dependence of the deposition velocity on particle relaxation time is over-predicted using the Saffman force. Since the derivation of the Saffman force there have been more general derivations of the lift on a particle in a shear flow. In this paper an ‘optimum’ lift force is formulated which represents the most accurate available description of the force acting on a particle in a wall-bounded shear flow. The effect of the force was examined through large eddy simulation (LES) of particle deposition in vertical turbulent channel flow. The optimum force for depositing particles is approximately three times smaller than the lift obtained using the Saffman formula. LES results also show that use of the optimum force yields a dependence of the deposition velocity on particle relaxation time less than that obtained using the Saffman form and in better agreement with experimental measurements. Neglecting the lift force altogether leads to an even smaller dependence of the deposition velocity on particle relaxation time and is in better agreement with empirical relations, although the deposition rates are smaller than experimental measurements for particles with intermediate relaxation times.},

The annual flow field with the presence of drillpipe rotation is described through analyzing various rotation conditions. The results indicate that the quasi-spiral flow is the main flow pattern for liquid-solid transport in the horizontal annulus. The influence of rotation on the cuttings transport is also investigated, as the rotation of drillpipe increases the disturbance of liquid to solid in annulus. As a result, the solid flow becomes favorable and the solid volume is reduced. Comparisons with previously published results are also performed to prove the importance of drillpipe rotation in the wellbore clearing for the ERD.},

  abstract = {Abstract Hole cleaning is one of the key issues in extended reach drilling, the thickness of cutting bed monitor and control is the critical technique which urgent to solve. Based on solid-liquid flow mechanics, considering actions between the layers, slip between solid and liquid phase, and rotation of drill pipe, a three layer dynamic cutting transport model was developed, staggered mesh and Stability Enhancing Two Step method were adopted for the simulation. The influence factors of the thickness of cutting bed were analyzed, ECD with variable cutting bed can be accurately predicted, by compare the measured ECD with the theoretical value, the thickness of cutting bed can be monitored, and this technique has been successfully used in the oil field of South China Sea. The research results show that high angle hold segment is the most difficult segment for cutting transport. The pump can not reach the minimum flow rate for keeping the hole cleaning. Low viscosity drilling fluid, high flow rate and drill pipe rotation should be adopted, and when the thickness of cutting bed exceeds 10\%, flushing method must be used to remove the cuttings, the recommended flushing period is 150m. By this model, the dynamic process of cutting transport during drilling and flushing can be simulated. Giving a guideline to the design of hydraulic parameters, and offering an effective field method to monitor and control the hole cleaning in extended reach well. Introduction South China Sea is rich in oil and gas resources, it was known as "Second Persian Bay??. ERW (Extended Reach Well), as a cost-effective technology to develop offshore oil and gas fields, was more and more widely used in there. Because of high inclined angle, long distance and serious eccentricity, cuttings accumulate easily in the high angle and horizontal segment, that will cause wellbore instability, formed key slot, tool sticking, and et, al. Endless accidents happened because of the hole is not clean(ZHANG, et al, 2009; YONG, et al, 2002; PAYNE, et al, 1994). Cutting transport mechanics has been studied by many researchers(WANG, et al, 2009; SONG, et al, 2009; BILGESU, et al, 2007; WANG Z, et al, 2006; WANG and ZHANG, 2004; CHO, et al, 2000 ; NGUYEN and RAHMAN, 1996), and several steady models have been developed. Cutting transport in the steady state can be analyzed but the distribution of cuttings vary with time cannot be simulated by existing steady models, it will cause inaccurate prediction when the inclined angle is big and the horizontal segment is long. Moreover, because of the complexity of real process and the immature of solid-liquid fluid mechanics, the effect of drill pipe rotation was not considered in existing cutting transport models, however, drill pipe rotation is an important factor affecting the hole cleaning(WANG, et al, 2009; OZBAYOGLU, et al, 2008; SANCHEZ, et al, 1999 ; LOCKETT, et al, 1993), ignoring this factor will cause great discrepancies when compare with field data. Therefore, a new model for hole cleaning monitoring and control in ERW is proposed to predict and interpret the cutting transport mechanism . Based on the above analysis, considering the feature of ERW, a dynamic three layers cutting transport model was built. The thickness of cutting bed can be monitored by comparing the measured ECD with the theoretical value, some effective field methods were given to keep hole cleaning.},

  abstract = {The penetration rate obtained with a roller cone bit is controlled by either the cuttings generation process or cuttings removal process. Most previously reported penetration rate models have not previously reported penetration rate models have not explicitly included the cuttings removal effects.This paper presents a penetration rate model that includes the effect of both the initial chip formation and cuttings removal processes. The model is an extension of a previously published model that neglected the effects of cuttings removal. The cuttings removal effects must be included in a valid penetration rate model because they can often penetration rate model because they can often the ROP to less than 20\% of the expected ROP for perfect cleaning. perfect cleaning. The model is used to show that the reduction in penetration rate at high borehole pressure is the penetration rate at high borehole pressure is the result of both local cratering effects and global cleaning effects. Increased hydraulics will increase the penetration rate when it is limited by global cleaning effects. The penetration rate reduction due to local cratering effects is largely a function of mud properties and borehole pressure and is not helped much by increases in hydraulics.IntroductionAlthough roller cone bits have been used for over 75 years, the complex mechanics and hydraulics involved with these bits has hindered the complete modeling of the drilling process. The combination of crushing and scraping of the teeth on a rolling cone makes it difficult to model the exact cratering process. The turbulent flow field of the mud under process. The turbulent flow field of the mud under the bit has not been completely modeled, so it is difficult to predict cuttings removal forces. The forces that hold cuttings to the formation can not be predicted very well because of the effects of mud properties on the equalization of the pressure properties on the equalization of the pressure around the chips. Consequently, most penetration rate models are based on empirical matching of experimental data.The complete drilling process is composed of a number of individual actions that must occur in order for the bit to penetrate. The complicated geometry of the bit makes measurement of the individual processes difficult, but test conditions can be designed to identify and model certain basic effects such as cuttings generation, cuttings removal, etc. By developing a model based on both theoretical concepts and experimental data taken under controlled conditions, the complex modeling problem can be reduced to a somewhat simpler one. problem can be reduced to a somewhat simpler one. After a basic model is developed, more complete conditions can be added to further define the model. If the physics of the process are handled property. the addition of the new conditions will not invalidate the previously determined model. The strategy described above was used to develop the model presented in this paper. The discussion of the model is intended mainly as a basis for presenting the effects of various parameters that control the rate of penetration (ROP). The model facilitates the comparison of the relative effects of changing various parameters that may be altered during drilling. It also aids in the evaluation of field bit performance to select conditions that may improve the ROP.},

  abstract = {In order to determine laminar friction losses of non-Newtonian drilling fluids it is standard practice to utilise a simple rheological model with parameter estimation via explicit solution of the required number of simultaneous equations. This limits the choice of available models and, together with the fitting procedure, frequently results in poor fits. Numerous alternative models have been proposed, but their worth has never been clearly demonstrated. Here we consider the rheological models to form the deterministic part of a stochastic model hence acknowledging that observed data arise from randomness due to the system. Parameter estimates are obtained by nonlinear least squares using data readings from eight standard Fann viscometer settings. Results are presented for 20 rheological models on 414 Fann viscometer data sets that encompass a variety of different drilling fluids. The goodness of fit of the models is assessed by comparing boxplots of the resulting residual mean square values. Several of the alternative models are shown to be consistently capable of excellent shear stress prediction over all of the shear rate range expected during drilling operations. The use of statistical methodology allows us to go beyond mere data relationship estimation: it permits the calculation of confidence intervals and tests of significance of functions of the model parameters, for example equivalent circulating density. The validity of such calculations relies on the extent to which the behaviour of the nonlinear least squares estimates approximates the asymptotic properties of being unbiased, normally distributed and minimum variance estimators. The estimation behaviour of the ‘best' fitting models is analysed and a reparameterised form of the Sisko model is identified as having reasonable behaviour. Thus, despite the small data size, when using this model form the subsequent estimates, confidence intervals and tests of significance of functions of the model parameters can be confidently reported.},

  abstract = {Abstract One of the main tasks of drilling fluids is to transport cuttings to the surface to clean the borehole. During this process the fluid is exposed to different flow regimes, shear rates and temperatures. The fluid properties affect the flow behavior, where viscosity, density and gel strength are among the key parameters. Field experience indicates that oil-based drilling fluids perform better in terms of hole cleaning than water-based fluids do, even if viscosity and density values are similar. The exact reasons for this are not entirely understood and increased knowledge will contribute towards more efficient drilling operations. To deepen the understanding of the hole-cleaning abilities of drilling fluids, a comparative study with oil-based and water-based drilling fluids with similar viscosity profiles was executed. Flow-loop experiments in a 10 m long test section with a free-whirling rotating inner drill string are correlated to rheological investigations on a Fann 35 viscometer and an Anton Paar rheometer. The Fann 35 measurements follow the ISO/API standards and include viscosity and gel-strength measurements. With the Anton Paar rheometer flow curves and temperature dependence were obtained. This paper presents selected rheological properties in correlation to flow-loop experiments in order to get a better understanding of the unequal behavior in solids transport of the two drilling fluid types. The presented results include yield point and plastic viscosity determination. In addition Herschel-Bulkley and power-law regressions were used to obtain comparable yield-point values. The rheometer measurements provide more detailed data due to extended functionality of the instrument, higher accuracy for each measuring point and a higher number of data points acquired compared to the Fann viscometer. The yield point of the fluids is expected to influence mainly the static and the low-flow conditions in the wellbore, whereas the plastic viscosity may have more importance in the high-shear region of the flow. To draw back conclusions from the rheology measurements to the flow-loop results, these two points are highlighted in this study.},

Although it has long been reasoned that the dynamical interactions between polymers and turbulence are responsible for DR, it was not until recently that progress had been made to begin to elucidate these interactions in detail. These advancements come largely from numerical simulations of viscoelastic turbulent flows and detailed turbulence measurements in flows of dilute polymer solutions using laser-based optical techniques.

  title = {Calculation of {{Drillpipe Rotation Effects}} on {{Fluids}} in {{Axial Flow}}: {{An Engineering Approach}}},
  abstract = {The usefulness of drill pipe rotation in drilling and cementation has been debated over the past several years. In recent years, the positive effects of pipe rotation on hole cleaning, particularly in highly-deviated wellbores, has been noted. However, many engineers are unsure of the usefulness of drill pipe rotation because the effect has not been quantified. One reason for this is that the effect of drill pipe rotation on non-Newtonian drilling fluids in annular flow is not a well understood phenomenon. There has been no single, valid method developed to mathematically characterize rotation effects on point velocities for non-Newtonian fluids in axial flow. In this paper, the effect of drill string rotation on axial flow is investigated from a fluid dynamics perspective. Using the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model, calculations for pure laminar flow and rotation are coupled to obtain shear rate characterization across the annulus. Developed first for fluids in concentric flow, these methods will be later expanded to handle the effects of drill pipe rotation in eccentric geometries. Using this method to mathematically characterize the effect of drill string rotation on axial velocity can lead to better understanding of annular flow behavior under normal drilling and circulating conditions. Areas such as hole cleaning in high angle wellbores, rotation speeds necessary to effect good annular cleanup prior to cementing, etc., will find useful application for this mathematical modeling technique. Moreover, in today’s complex wells where a narrow operating window exists between pore pressure and fracture gradients, any improved understanding of factors that change annular pressure drop and velocity patterns can be critical to the success of the drilling operation.},

  abstract = {The drilling community generally believes that pipe rotation helps hole cleaning during both drilling and cementing. However, there has been a lack of reliable calculations to describe the effect and application in engineering and design and deployment. This paper discusses the effect of pipe rotation on velocity profile and pressure drop in concentric and eccentric annulus during the axial flow of non-Newtonian fluid. The calculations are applied to the design of hole cleaning during drilling and cementing. In the absence of reliable calculations one can only guess the impact of pipe rotation on hole cleaning. This work gives an engineer the tool to design for improved hole cleaning and hence save time and money during well construction and production. Pipe rotation is all the more important in an eccentric annulus to remove the drill cuttings and the gelled drilling fluid from the narrow annulus. This is because in an eccentric annulus, in the absence of pipe rotation, the fluid flows preferentially through the wider annulus. The pipe rotation speed (i.e., the RPM) required to move the gelled drilling fluid and the drill cuttings in various annulus configurations and eccentricities are presented. The results discussed in this paper can be applied for effective hole cleaning during drilling and cementing, which should save non- productive time (NPT) during drilling and cementing and also reduce remedial and intervention costs during well production.},

  isbn = {1-972952-94-3},
  abstract = {The ability to accurately predict the effect of drill pipe rotation on Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) remains a challenge for those involved in engineering today’s complex wells. In many of these challenging wells (extended-reach drilling, deepwater, HPHT, etc.), the safe drilling window between hole collapse and fracturing is often narrow. Improvement in prediction of the effect of drill pipe rotation speed on ECD would allow better optimization of operational parameters in the drilling process, and hopefully reduce the incidence of operating beyond the safe drilling window. Field ECD measurements made with downhole annular pressure tools at different circulation rates and drill pipe rotation speeds (e.g., ‘fingerprinting’ exercises) were modeled and presented to the industry. The presented results constituted the best-available correlation with direct downhole pressure measurements, but still showed improvement was needed. As a bridge between the earlier complex model and the one discussed in this paper, a simplified correlation was developed to give quick method of calculation of increase in ECD as a function of changing drill pipe rotation speed. Since the development of the simplified correlation, more work has been done to improve modeling accuracy of the data set used earlier. It was found that the reduced accuracy of the earlier complex model was the result of under-prediction of the annular shear rates resulting from the axial and tangential flows that, when coupled together, produce helical flow. In this paper, a new shear rate calculation is used and the increased accuracy of the modeling is shown using the measured field data presented earlier. The improved correlation helps in better understanding circulating pressures incurred while drilling and how they relate to hole cleaning, particle suspension, and wellbore instability.

  shorttitle = {{{SPE}}-135703-{{MS}}},
  abstract = {The drilling industry has long had problems with debris left in the hole after completion of drilling and prior to a trip or to the running of a casing string or a production liner. Debris left in the hole can also lead to poor cement bonding with the formation. This problem can be especially bad in high angle or horizontal wellbores, where often large quantities of the debris can accumulate on the low side of the hole, thereby creating a lengthy interval potential cleaning problems.

Historically the industry has used centralizers and other tools to achieve a certain level of stand-off, whereby the axial flow of drilling fluid or completion fluids can flow past the debris and slowly remove the unwanted solids accumulation. The rotation of drill pipe to aid in wellbore cleanout has been used for many years, but the question of ‘how fast??? remains. In addition, many other ‘creative' techniques have been tried in order to solve the problem, sometimes with some success and other times with little success. However, no model specific for wellbore cleanout in cases such as this exists.

In the last few years, the modeling of drill pipe rotation in drilling situations has advanced to the point where the helical flow characteristics of non-Newtonian drilling fluids can now be mapped in an annulus subject to axial and rotational flow. The axial and tangential velocities can be coupled to produce the annular point velocities for concentric and eccentric geometry. In this work, the velocity modeling is applied to predict wellbore cleanout efficiency for various particle sizes as functions of fluid shear stress in the annular flow stream and drillpipe rotation speed. Results will show rotational speeds required for the cleanout of small particles such as sand and for much larger-sized drilled cuttings.},

  abstract = {Due to their complex formulations, Drilling Fluids and
especially Oil base Muds exhibit very complex rheological
properties. They are commonly described as thixotropic shear
thinning fluids with a yield stress. A set of standards
established by the American Petroleum Institute is available
for the rheological characterization of these fluids and
classical descriptions with non-Newtonian fluids such as yield
power law models are typically employed. Although these
descriptions and measurements are adequate for classical
drilling situations, they reveal to be insufficient to describe
more complex phenomena as barite sag, or pressure peak due
to transient gel breaking on restart. In particular ultra low
shear rate rheology has been early accepted as a key parameter
for determining sag potential, and is poorly described by the
classical models and measurements. On the other hand, timedependent
behavior (classically apprehended in static
conditions through Gel 0 and Gel 10 measurements), which
can be very significant even in dynamic conditions, is not
quantitatively linked to the rheological description.
This paper describes how a simple thixotropic and structural
model is able to describe completely all the features of the
rheological behavior of drilling muds. The parameters of the
model can be simply deduced from on site measurement using
Fann 35 rheometer. We show that mud viscosity results at any
moment from the competition between aging and shear
rejuvenation. As a consequence, viscosity bifurcation (abrupt
transition towards complete stoppage or rapid shear) may
appear at low shear, which might explain the occurrence of
barite sag. Finally, it is shown how any transient phenomena
like pressure peaks when starting a pump after circulation
stoppage may be adequately predicted by using this model in
hydraulic calculation.},

  abstract = {The three-layer model concept developed previously for solid–liquid flow has been adapted to model solids transport in inclined channels. The present model predicts the pressure loss and transport rate of solids in Newtonian and power-law fluid suspensions by assuming stratified flow conditions. Sets of stationary sand bed transport rate tests were performed to verify the predictions of the model. A 70-mm flow loop was constructed to measure the average transport rates and critical flow rates, which are required to initiate the motion of solids bed particles. The tests were carried out by eroding stationary sand beds with water and an aqueous solution of poly anionic cellulose (PAC) in a transparent pipe. Four sand beds with different particle size ranges were used. The average transport rates of the beds were predicted using the model. The model predictions show a satisfactory agreement with experimentally measured results when the grain Reynolds number is between 15 and 400 and the flow rate is sufficiently higher than the critical flow rate.

  abstract = {Efficient cuttings transport and hole cleaning is very important for obtaining an effective drilling operation. In inclined and horizontal drilling, hole cleaning issues is a common and complex problem. This thesis explores the impact of various drilling parameters, and how they affect the required flow velocity and flow rate required for effective cuttings transport. The main objectives of the thesis are outlined as follows:  To make a sufficient review of previous studies;  Explain the fundamentals of the cuttings transport parameters and definitions;  To introduce and explain in great details the empirical model focusing on the models of Larsen and Rubiandini;  To make an introduction to the mechanistic modeling approach focusing on demonstrating the complexity of these models;  To apply Larsen‟s and Rubiandini‟s models in order to compare and identify similarities and differences between the models;  To present some field experience from offshore;  To draw conclusions about what we can learn from earlier studies and research. The thesis employs two models developed by an empirical approach, namely Larsen‟s model and Rubiandini‟s model. Two simulation scenarios have been considered. First, we have compared the models using the cases defined by Larsen from his experimental work. Then, an example well has been considered which mimics more operational conditions. Moreover, the thesis presents the mechanistic two-layer model developed by Kamp and Rivero, and demonstrates how the model has to be reformulated mathematically before a numerical method can be used for solving the model. The analysis of the two empirical models showed that both models show the same trend for required cuttings transport flow velocity and flow rate when drilling parameters, such as mud weight, ROP, mud rheology and drill-pipe diameter varied. For the horizontal case, we observe that Larsen predicts flow rate that are not far from the flow rates typical seen in operations, however it slightly over predicts required cuttings transport velocity. Rubiandini‟s model seems to predict high flow rate required for cuttings transport. However, for the vertical case, the predicted rate seems to coincide with flow rates typical in operations. The main advantage of Rubiandini‟s model is that in his work, he considered RPM as a variable that could affect the cuttings transport. The results also indicate that Larsen‟s model and Rubiandini‟s model show the opposite effect on required cuttings transport velocity when the cuttings size is a variable parameter. In the Larsen‟s model, smaller cuttings required higher flow velocity to be transported, while inthe Rubiandini‟s model, the opposite is observed, namely larger cuttings need a higher flow velocity for transport in the wellbore. In the conclusion, several recommendations on how to achieve better cuttings transport and hole cleaning are listed.},

  abstract = {Beds of cuttings are usually formed on the bottom of large, high-angle wellbores during drilling. When the drill string is moved axially along the wellbore, large bottom-hole assembly elements such as drill bit and stabilizers tend to plow the cuttings bed, thereby causing the formation of plugs of cuttings which give rise to high overpulls, loss of circulation, continuous need for operations such as backreaming, and stuck pipe. To reduce the likelihood of these costly hole problems occurring, it is necessary to minimize the height of the cuttings bed which forms while drilling, and to minimize the tendency of the bottom-hole assembly to form plugs of cuttings. This can be done with a new hole cleaning tool described in this paper. This tool was developed using a combination of analytical modeling based on fluid mechanics first principles, experimental data, and field data. The tool enables establishment of pump flow rates, drilling fluid rheological properties, drill string configurations, and well profiles for minimal risk of experiencing problems associated with the existence of a cuttings bed.},

  abstract = {Rheological behaviour is an important fluid property that severely impacts its flow
behaviour and many aspects related to this. In the case of activated sludge, the apparent
viscosity has an influence on e.g. pumping, hydrodynamics, mass transfer rates, sludgee
water separation (settling and filtration). It therefore is an important property related to
process performance, including process economics. To account for this, rheological
behaviour is being included in process design, necessitating its measurement. However,
measurements and corresponding protocols in literature are quite diverse, leading to
varying results and conclusions. In this paper, a vast amount of papers are critically
reviewed with respect to this and important flaws are highlighted with respect to
rheometer choice, rheometer settings and measurement protocol. The obtained rheograms
from experimental efforts have frequently been used to build viscosity models. However,
this is not that straightforward and a lot of errors can be detected with respect to good
modelling practice, including fair model selection criteria, qualitative parameter estimations
and proper model validation. These important steps are however recurrently
violated, severely affecting the model reliability and predictive power. This is illustrated
with several examples. In conclusion, dedicated research is required to improve the
rheological measurements and the models derived from them. At this moment, there is no
guidance with respect to proper rheological measurements. Moreover, the rheological
models are not very trustworthy and remain very “black box”. More insight in the physical
background needs to be gained. A model-based approach with dedicated experimental data
collection is the key to address this.},

  title = {Flow of a {{Non}}-{{Newtonian Bingham Plastic Fluid Over}} a {{Rotating Disk}}},
  abstract = {Even though fluid mechanics is well developed as a science, there are many physical phenomena that we do not yet fully understand. One of these is the deformation rates and fluid stresses generated in a boundary layer for a non-Newtonian fluid. One such non-Newtonian fluid would be a waxy crude oil flowing in a centrifugal pump. This type of flow can be numerically modeled by a rotating disk system, in combination with an appropriate constitutive equation, such as the relation for a Bingham fluid. A Bingham fluid does not begin to flow until the stress magnitude exceeds the yield stress. However, experimental measurements are also required to serve as a database against which the results of the numerical simulation can be interpreted and validated. The purpose of the present research is to gain a better understanding of the behavior of a Bingham fluid in the laminar boundary layer on a rotating disk. For this project, two different techniques were employed: numerical simulation, and laboratory investigations using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and flow visualization. Both methods were applied to the flow of a Bingham fluid over a rotating disk. In the numerical investigations, the flow was characterized by the dimensionless yield stress “Bingham number”, By, which is the ratio of the yield and viscous stresses. Using von Kármán’s similarity transformation, and introducing the rheological behavior of the fluid into the conservation equations, the corresponding nonlinear two-point boundary value problem was formulated. A solution to the problem under investigation was obtained by numerical integration of the set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using a multiple shooting method. The influence of the Bingham number on the flow behavior was identified. It decreases the magnitude of the radial and axial velocity components, and increases the magnitude of the tangential velocity component, which has a pronounced effect on the moment coefficient, CM, and the volume flow rate, Q. In the laboratory investigations, since the waxy crude oils are naturally opaque, an ambitious experimental plan to create a transparent oil that was rheologically similar to the Amna waxy crude oil from Libya was developed. The simulant was used for flow visualization experiments, where a transparent fluid was required. To fulfill the demand of the PIV system for a higher degree of visibility, a second Bingham fluid was created and rheologically investigated. The PIV measurements were carried out for both filtered tap water and the Bingham fluid in the same rotating disk apparatus that was used for the flow visualization experiments. Both the axial and radial velocity components in the (r-z) plane were measured for various rotational speeds. Comparison between the numerical and experimental results for the axial and radial velocity profiles for water was found to be satisfactory. Significant discrepancies were found between numerical results and measured values for the Bingham fluid, especially at low rotational speeds, mostly relating to the formation of a yield surface within the tank. iii},

This new diameter accounts for both annular geometry and the effects of a non-Newtonian fluid. It provides the link between Newtonian pipe flow and non-Newtonian flow through concentric annuli. The method is valid in any flow regime and can be used to determine whether a non-Newtonian flow is laminar, transitional, or turbulent. An analytical procedure is developed for computing frictional pressure gradients in all three flow regimes. The analysis also quantifies how flow transition is delayed by increasing the yield stress of a fluid. In addition, it is shown that transition in an annulus is delayed to higher pump rates as the ratio of inner to outer diameter increases. Furthermore, the method accounts for wall roughness and its affects on transitional and turbulent pressure gradients for non-Newtonian flow through pipes and concentric annuli. Finally, the method runs on a 386 PC in only a few seconds.},

It is the goal of the present study to investigate the effects which viscoelasticity has on this state and to identify the mechanisms responsible for wake stabilization. It is found through numerical simulations (employing the FENE-P rheological model) that viscoelasticity greatly reduces the amount of turbulence in the wake, reverting it back to a state which qualitatively appears similar to the Newtonian mode B instability which occurs at lower Re. By focusing on the separated shear layers, it is found that viscoelasticity suppresses the formation of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability which dominates for Newtonian flows, consistent with previous studies of viscoelastic free shear layers. Through this shear layer stabilization, the viscoelastic far wake is then subject to the same instability mechanisms which dominate for Newtonian flows, but at far lower Reynolds numbers.},

High-quality bed-load transport data sets are identified and analyzed, showing that the bed-load transport in the sand range is related to velocity to power 2.5. The bed-load transport is not much affected by particle size. The prediction of bed roughness is addressed and the prediction of bed-load transport in steady river flow is extended to coastal flow applying an intrawave approach. Simplified bed-load transport formulas are presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of bed-load transport in river and coastal flows. It is shown that the sediment transport of fine silts to coarse sand can be described in a unified model framework using fairly simple expressions. The proposed model is fully predictive in the sense that only the basic hydrodynamic parameters (depth, current velocity, wave height, wave period, etc.) and the basic sediment characteristics ( d10 , d50 , d90 , water temperature, and salinity) need to be known. The prediction of the effective bed roughness is an integral part of the model.},

  abstract = {The problem of suspended sediment transport in river and coastal flows is addressed. High-quality field data of river and coastal flows have been selected and clustered into four particle size classes (60–100, 100–200, 200–400, and 400–600 μm ). The suspended sand transport is found to be strongly dependent on particle size and on current velocity. The suspended sand transport in the coastal zone is found to be strongly dependent on the relative wave height ( Hs ∕h) , particularly for current velocities in the range 0.2–0.5 m∕s . The time-averaged (over the wave period) advection–diffusion equation is applied to compute the time-averaged sand concentration profile for combined current and wave conditions. Flocculation, hindered settling, and stratification effects are included by fairly simple expressions. The bed-shear stress is based on a new bed roughness predictor. The reference concentration function has been recalibrated using laboratory and field data for combined steady and oscillatory flow. The computed transport rates show reasonably good agreement (within a factor of 2) with measured values for velocities in the range of 0.6–1.8 m∕s and sediments in the range of 60–600 μm . The proposed method underpredicts in the low-velocity range ($<$0.6 m∕s) . A new simplified transport formula is presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of suspended transport. The modeling of wash load transport in river flow based on the energy concept of Bagnold shows that an extremely large amount of very fine sediment (clay and very fine silt) can be transported by the flow.},

  abstract = {Foam drilling is increasingly used to develop low pressure reservoirs or highly depleted mature reservoirs because of minimizing the formation damage and potential hazardous drilling problems. Prediction of the cuttings concentration in the wellbore annulus as a function of operational drilling parameters such as wellbore geometry, pumping rate, drilling fluid rheology and density and maximum drilling rate is very important for optimizing these parameters. This paper describes a simple and more reliable artificial neural network (ANN) method and multiple linear regression (MLR) to predict cuttings concentration during foam drilling operation. This model is applicable for various borehole conditions using some critical parameters associated with foam velocity, foam quality, hole geometry, subsurface condition (pressure and temperature) and pipe rotation. The average absolute percent relative error (AAPE) between the experimental cuttings concentration and ANN model is less than 6\%, and using MLR, AAPE is less than 9\%. A comparison of the ANN and mechanistic model was done. The AAPE values for all datasets in this study were 3.2\%, 8.5\% and 10.3\% for ANN model, MLR model and mechanistic model respectively. The results show high ability of ANN in prediction with respect to statistical methods.},

  isbn = {978-1-61399-017-9},
  doi = {10.2118/94057-MS},
  abstract = {AbstractCoiled tubing (CT) is widely used in well intervention as a practical and cost-effective means of servicing wells. Over the years, the actual flow through CT has been a point of discussion and theory. Testing has been conducted to promote a better understanding of what happens inside the CT. In recent years, the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software has provided greater insight into actual CT flow patterns, including fluid-flow velocity profiles and secondary flow regimes. These flow patterns can be studied in a straight pipe or curved (CT) condition with variable flow rates and variable fluids. CFD could help us understand the phenomenon of erosion, including particle path and migration through the tubing. It might also lead to a greater understanding and efficient design of friction pressure gradients. After CFD is proven and established, an alternative to full-scale testing or other predictive methods may be possible.This paper discusses the flow phenomenon of CT using CFD, particularly over the tubing guide. This is an area of concern because the tubing configuration changes from straight to bent to straight again. Details of fluid flow for both the straight and curved sections have been examined to evaluate flow-velocity profiles and flow patterns. Fluids investigated have included water, gel, and slurry.IntroductionCT has long been used in the oil and gas industry to serve as an effective means for servicing wells. It is a faster and more cost-efficient process than conventional rig servicing. The application for CT varies widely and includes drilling, cementing, cleaning sand from a wellbore, fracturing, acidizing, scale removal, placement of tools, logging, fishing, and chemical placement.1-5 Many operators are attracted to CT processes because of its rapid deployment. The CT itself must be managed for life, safety, job design, and flow characteristics. Part of this management is understanding the events that occur inside the CT. For many years, flow through CT has only been a matter of discussion and theory. Some of the discussion has been related to whether flow through CT has the same characteristics as flow through standard tubing. Other discussions involve whether centrifugal forces play a part in the coiled or wrapped sections of the tubing. If centrifugal forces are involved, how do the secondary flow regimes effect the total flow? Mysteries have persisted until recently because many theories were hard to either prove or disprove. Theories can also change based on the fluid being used. For example, Newtonian fluids may act differently than non-Newtonian fluids, and the addition of sand or proppant can also affect results. Taking advantage of technologies used in other industries (such as CFD) can provide tools to help us understand fluid flow characteristics in CT. The better understanding of fluid flow through CT can lead to better job management, better job design, and more efficient use of CT and pumping equipment. This paper will describe some of the secrets to proper flow analysis, which can depend in large part on the way the software parameters are loaded and applied. CFD SoftwareThe use of CFD software has grown to become a large part of fluid dynamics investigation. In recent years, the use of CFD software in the oil and gas industry has steadily increased. This technology has allowed the modeling of complex physical fluid phenomena that in the past were extremely difficult to simulate or measure. The CFD software is a much more cost-effective means to investigate fluid systems and also provides more rapid results. When established, CFD software helps enable us to predict what will happen when single or multiple parameters change. For this study, FLUENT CFD software was used to study the flow characteristics of various fluids. These fluids included water modeled as a Newtonian fluid, gel modeled as a non-Newtonian fluid, and a sand-laden gel modeled as a non-Newtonian slurry. The geometry modeling was performed in 3-D solid-model format using SolidWorks software. The fluid domain of the CT geometry was exported in ACIS format from SolidWorks software to GAMBIT software. GAMBIT software is the preprocessor to FLUENT software where geometry is created, meshing is performed, and boundary conditions are established.},

  abstract = {A spectral element—Fourier method (SEM) for Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the turbulent flow of non-New- tonian fluids is described and the particular requirements for non-Newtonian rheology are discussed. The method is imple- mented in parallel using the MPI message passing kernel, and execution times scale somewhat less than linearly with the number of CPUs, however this is more than compensated by the improved simulation turn around times. The method is applied to the case of turbulent pipe flow, where simulation results for a shear-thinning (power law) fluid are compared to those of a yield stress (Herschel–Bulkley) fluid at the same generalised Reynolds number. It is seen that the yield stress significantly dampens turbulence intensities in the core of the flow where the quasi-laminar flow region there co-exists with a transitional wall zone. An additional simulation of the flow of blood in a channel is undertaken using a Carreau–Yasuda rheology model, and results compared to those of the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier– Stokes) model. Agreement between the mean flow velocity profile predictions is seen to be good.

  title = {Computational {{Fluid Dynamics}} of Dispersed Two-Phase Flows at High Phase Fractions},
  url = {http://powerlab.fsb.hr/ped/kturbo/OpenFOAM/docs/HenrikRuschePhD2002.pdf},
  abstract = {This study describes the development and validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) methodology for the simulation of dispersed two-phase 
ows.
A two-
uid (Euler-Euler) methodology previously developed at Imperial College
is adapted to high phase fractions. It employs averaged mass and momentum conservation
equations to describe the time-dependent motion of both phases and, due to the
averaging process, requires additional models for the inter-phase momentum transfer
and turbulence for closure. The continuous phase turbulence is represented using a
two-equation k ⬚⬚ "⬚⬚turbulence model which contains additional terms to account for
the e⬚ects of the dispersed on the continuous phase turbulence. The Reynolds stresses
of the dispersed phase are calculated by relating them to those of the continuous phase
through a turbulence response function.
The inter-phase momentum transfer is determined from the instantaneous forces
acting on the dispersed phase, comprising drag, lift and virtual mass. These forces are
phase fraction dependent and in this work revised modelling is put forward in order to
capture the phase fraction dependency of drag and lift. Furthermore, a correlation for
the e⬚ect of the phase fraction on the turbulence response function is proposed. The
revised modelling is based on an extensive survey of the existing literature.
The conservation equations are discretised using the ⬚nite-volume method and
solved in a solution procedure, which is loosely based on the PISO algorithm, adapted
to the solution of the two-
uid model. Special techniques are employed to ensure the
stability of the procedure when the phase fraction is high or changing rapidely.
Finally, assessment of the methodology is made with reference to experimental
data for gas-liquid bubbly 
ow in a sudden enlargement of a circular pipe and in a
plane mixing layer.
Additionally, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed using an
interface-capturing methodology in order to gain insight into the dynamics of free
rising bubbles, with a view towards use in the longer term as an aid in the development
of inter-phase momentum transfer models for the two-
uid methodology. The
direct numerical simulation employs the mass and momentum conservation equations
in their unaveraged form and the topology of the interface between the two phases is
determined as part of the solution. A novel solution procedure, similar to that used
for the two-
uid model, is used for the interface-capturing methodology, which allows
calculation of air bubbles in water. Two situations are investigated: bubbles rising in
a stagnant liquid and in a shear 
ow. Again, experimental data are used to verify the
computational results.},

  title = {On Modeling the Deposition of Drill Cuttings and Mud on the Sea Floor},
  url = {http://www.sintef.com/globalassets/project/erms/reports/publications/paper-2005-imems.pdf},
  abstract = {Experience has shown that discharges of drill cuttings and mud from a platf01m have
sinking velocities considerably above what is expected from the sinking velocities of
the individual cuttings and barite (weighting material) particles. The reason for this is
pa1t ly due to formation of larger pa1ticles when the discharge mud has "sticky"
prope1ties (for SBM and OBM), and pa1tly because a near-field plume is f01med with
a density larger than the ambient water.
When WBM is used, the downward motiom of the pa1ticles may still be enhanced due
to the downward motion of the near-field plume. However, the f01mation of larger
pa1t icles may not be evident in this case because the "sticky" prope1ties of the mud
are absent. It is sometimes argued that "flocculation processes" may still f01m larger
pa1t icles which will enhance the sinking velocities of the pa1ticles also for the WBM
case.
The presence or absence of these "flocculation processes" are imp01tant for the
calculation of the deposition, because larger sinking velocities will tend to concentrate
the debris closer to the drilling site, compared to calculations that does not include the
effects from flocculation processes.
The paper explains the eff01ts unde1taken to examine the presence of "flocculation
processes" for discharges of WBM. These effo1ts include a comparisons between
measured and model simulated depositions ofbarite on the sea floor when WBM is
used, an extrapolation of results from laborat01y experiments to examine the expected
imp01tance of the flocculation processes, a re-examination of field data collected on
the US coast (the CAMP study) and finally obse1vations of the pa1t icle prope1ties
from an ROV present in the discharge area during actual drilling with WBM.},

The difficulty in removing cuttings bed during drilling arises because of the drilling fluid interacts with the cuttings in cuttings bed to form a cuttings bed gel. The drilling fluid composition can be designed to minimize the gel formation in the cuttings bed. At the same time the drilling fluid properties are optimized to ensure a sufficient shear stress on the cuttings particles to be able to remove the cuttings. This technique has been used in several of Statoil's drilling operations. The paper explains the effect of the cuttings bed properties on hole cleaning in detail. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how the drilling operations were improved compared to earlier drilling operations using conventional drilling fluids. From drilling operations in North Sea fields it is shown how the total drilling progress is improved. The torque curves of comparable wells are shown. These curves demonstrate that a significantly improved hole cleaning have been experienced in the wells drilled with the drilling fluid made to minimize cuttings bed gel formation.},

The viscosity measurements of the Tylose solutions showed shear-thinning behaviour, and the oscillatory and creep tests measured elastic components of the stress of the order of the minimal detectable values by the rheometer. These low molecular weight polymer solutions delayed transition from the laminar to the turbulent regime and showed drag reductions of half that reported to occur with other low elasticity shear-thinning high molecular aqueous polymer solutions. Near the wall the axial turbulent stress was higher than with water, whereas the two transverse components of turbulence were reduced. This near-wall behaviour is typical of drag reducing fluids based on high molecular weight polymers, but in the core of the pipe the three components of turbulence were higher than for the water flows, especially in the radial and tangential directions.},

  title = {An {{Experimental Evaluation Of Correlations Used For Predicting Cutting Slip Velocity}}},
  isbn = {978-1-55563-732-3},

  abstract = {Abstract Several particle slip velocity correlations have been developed for predicting the carrying capacity of drilling fluids. In this investigation, the published correlations of (1) Preston Moore, (2) published correlations of (1) Preston Moore, (2) Sze-Foo Chien, and (3) Walker and Mayes were evaluated using data obtained in the laboratory under both static and flowing fluid conditions. Data previously published by Sifferman et al. using a previously published by Sifferman et al. using a full-scale vertical annulus also was utilized in this investigation. In addition, a new simplified approach was developed for establishing the carrying capacity of drilling fluids. The procedure involves the use of cutting slip-velocity measurements taken in a static column of fluid. This value for slip velocity is then used to predict cutting transport for flowing conditions. Cutting transport ratio provides an excellent measure of carrying capacity. A convenient linear relationship was found to exist between cutting transport ratio and the reciprocal of annular velocity. When each of the proposed correlations and the new technique were evaluated with respect to the experimental data, the new technique was the only procedure to consistently yield results of acceptable procedure to consistently yield results of acceptable accuracy for the engineering design of drilling operations. Of the three published correlations evaluated, the method proposed by Preston Moore provided the best agreement with the experimental provided the best agreement with the experimental data. Introduction The primary function of drilling fluids in the rotary drilling process is to clean the rock fragments from beneath the bit and transport these cuttings to the surface. Drilling problems related to carrying capacity can result from insufficient as well as excessive annular velocities. When annular velocities are insufficient to effectively transport cuttings to the surface, problems of decreased bit life and slow penetration rates can occur. These problems result penetration rates can occur. These problems result when cuttings are reground several times before they are removed from the bit area. Cutting concentration buildup in the annulus can result in hole fill-up near bottom during trips and even stuck pipe if the cuttings pack off around the drill collars. Lost circulation problems can also occur if the increased cutting concentration produces a sufficient increase in mud density to cause formation fracture. It also must be recognized that excessive annular velocities can cause a reduction in penetration rate. Frictional pressure losses penetration rate. Frictional pressure losses experienced in the drillstring increase as the drilling fluid velocity increases. When the frictional pressure losses in the drillstring are high, the fluid energy available for cleaning at the bit is greatly reduced, again resulting in wasteful regrinding of the rock fragments and poor bottom-hole cleaning. These factors indicate that an optimum annular velocity does exist that is related to the carrying capacity of the drilling fluid in use. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate experimentally the available slip-velocity correlations used for determining the carrying capacity of drilling fluids. The correlations included in this study are those of Preston Moore Sze-Foo Chien, and Walker and Mayes. In addition, a new technique for determining carrying capacity is presented and evaluated. Experimental data used in presented and evaluated. Experimental data used in the evaluation were obtained in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids for both static and flowing conditions. This investigation used data obtained in the laboratory as well as data previously published by Sifferman et al. using a full-scale published by Sifferman et al. using a full-scale vertical annulus. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Williams and Bruce were among the first researchers to recognize the need for establishing a minimum average annular velocity to remove formation cuttings from the borehole.

  shorttitle = {{{SPE}}-56406-{{PA}}},
  abstract = {The effect of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning during directional-well drilling is investigated. An 8 in. diameter wellbore simulator, 100 ft long, with a 4½ in. drillpipe was used for the study. The variables considered in this experimental work are: rotary speed, hole inclination, mud rheology, cuttings size, and mud flow rate. Over 600 tests were conducted.The rotary speed was varied from 0 to 175 rpm. High viscosity and low viscosity bentonite muds and polymer muds were used with ¼ in. crushed limestone and 1/10 in. river gravel cuttings. Four hole inclinations were considered: 40°, 65°, 80°, and 90° from vertical.The results show that drillpipe rotation has a significant effect on hole cleaning during directional-well drilling, contrary to what has been published by previous researchers who forced the drillpipe to rotate about its own axis. The level of enhancement due to pipe rotation is a function of the simultaneous combination of mud rheology, cuttings size, and mud flow rate. Also it was observed that the dynamic behavior of the drillpipe (steady state vibration, unsteady sate vibration, whirling rotation, true axial rotation parallel to hole axis, etc.) plays a major role on the significance in the improvement of hole cleaning.Generally, smaller cuttings are more difficult to transport. However, at high rotary speed and with high viscosity muds, the smaller cuttings seem to become easier to transport. Generally, in inclined wells, low viscosity muds clean better than high viscosity muds, depending on cuttings size, viscosity, and rotary speed level.IntroductionNumerous studies on cuttings transport have been conducted for the past two decades. Although several investigators have made observations on the effect of drillpipe rotation, most have focused their studies on mud rheology and annular velocities. This is the first time an extensive experimental study is conducted with the sole purpose of investigating the effect of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning.In the past, the effect of drillpipe rotation was thought to be minimal. This belief was based on the results of experiments which were conducted in flow loops that used centralizers to constrain the pipe to rotate on its own axis, avoiding any orbital motion. Although the motion of the pipe will change at different positions along the well, it is now believed that in most cases the drillstring will have both rotary and orbital motion, even when in tension. In this case, it is the orbital motion and not the rotation that improves hole cleaning. When the pipe is rotating only along its axis, it will cause a shift and a slight increase in the velocity profile in the annular area, causing the velocities on one side of the hole to be higher than on the other. Generally, a no slip condition at the boundaries in the annulus is assumed. These include the boundary between the hole or casing and the fluid, the boundary between the fluid and the drillpipe, and the boundary between the fluid and the cuttings bed. If the pipe is not rotating, the velocity of the fluid particles at these boundaries is zero. When the pipe rotates, this boundary condition means that the velocity of the fluid particles adjacent to drillpipe is equal to the rotational speed of the pipe, perpendicular to the hole axis, resulting in a pseudo-helical flow. The minor effects observed in tests conducted under this configuration (using centralizers) indicate that the shift and the increase of the annular velocities are minor and do not affect cuttings transport significantly. On the other hand, the orbital motion of the pipe improves the transport of cuttings significantly in two ways: First, the mechanical agitation of the cuttings in an inclined hole sweeps the cuttings resting on the lower side of the hole into the upper side, where the annular velocity is higher. Second, the orbital motion exposes the cuttings under the drillstring cyclically to the moving fluid particles. Even though investigators have been aware of this phenomenon, it has usually been ignored for several reasons: First, the orbital motion of the string will generally reduce the cuttings concentration in the annulus, and therefore ignoring it was thought to be a conservative approach. Second, the dynamics of the drillstring in the wellbore is still not well understood. Also, the borehole simulators currently available that allow simulation of pipe rotation assume that the pipe does not orbitate. However, the reduction in cuttings concentration and improvement on bed erosion are too high to be ignored. Furthermore, recent advances in drillstring dynamics could eventually evolve into a complex cuttings transport simulator that accounts for orbital motion.As will be shown, the benefit of pipe rotation to hole cleaning is a function mainly of rotary speed, hole inclination, and flow rate, mud rheology, and cuttings size. The latter two have the least effect.ExperimentsOver 600 tests were conducted at The University of Tulsa (TUDRP) cuttings transport facility. A full scale 8 in.×100 ft wellbore simulator (Fig. 1) with 4½ in. drillpipe was used. A data acquisition system records information every second. The information recorded allows monitoring of cuttings concentration (mass in the test section) throughout the duration of each test. A detailed description of the facility is given in Refs. 2 and 3.Test Procedure.The test procedure was designed to study the effect of pipe rotation on:Cuttings concentration while drilling (at steady state conditions),Bed erosion after drilling has stopped,Cuttings transport patterns.},

  url = {http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:565946},
  abstract = {Drilling fluids make up an essential part of the drilling operation.
Successful drilling operations rely on adequate drilling fluid quality.
With the development of new drilling techniques such as long
deviated sections and drilling in ultra-deep waters, the standard of
required performance of the drilling fluids continue to increase.
Narrow pressure margins and low tolerance for barite sag requires
accurate prediction of the gel evolution in drilling fluids. Increased
knowledge of how drilling fluids behave during low shear rates can
lead to better design of drilling fluids to avoid settling of heavy
particles at the wellbore. Settling of heavy particles at the wellbore
can lead to serious incidents such as stuck pipe, lost circulation, poor
cement jobs and well control difficulties. Studies on the gel evolution
of oil based drilling fluids could be used to optimize hydraulic
modelling and evaluate phenomena such as fluid loss, barite sag and
cuttings transport.
The objective of this report was to investigate the gel evolution, low
shear viscosity and viscoelastic properties of oil based drilling fluids.
Literature study and experimental investigations were performed on
water based and oil based drilling fluids to extend the understanding
of low shear viscosity of oil based drilling fluids.
Literature study performed on low shear viscosity of drilling fluids
confirmed that there is a need for improved models for describing
dynamic yield point and low shear behaviour. A case study performed
illustrates the relevance of the topic, and the consequences
unexpected gel effects could have when drilling a well.
Two water based drilling fluid samples and one oil based drilling fluid
sample were prepared and tested. Quantitative information about the
dynamic properties of drilling fluids was found. Flow curves and gel
strength were measured using a Fann viscometer. Four different
drilling fluid samples were investigated using an Anton Paar Physica
rheometer. Oscillatory tests such as amplitude sweeps determined
linear viscoelastic range (LVE). Determination of the linear
viscoelastic range was necessary to further investigate viscoelastic
properties by performing frequency sweeps within the LVE range.
Both amplitude sweeps and frequency sweeps were performed at
different frequencies and strains. The viscoelastic properties
investigated were structure formation, structure breakage and low
shear viscosity. The effect of variables such as temperature,
frequency, time of rest on dynamic yield point and viscous and elastic
modulus was investigated by varying these variables in series of
experiments. Experiments performed conclude that there is little correlation
between the dynamic yield point found from extrapolation of flow
curves using the Herschel Bulkley model and the Bingham plastic
model, and the dynamic yield point found from amplitude sweeps.
Amplitude sweeps showed that the three samples of drilling fluids
exhibit viscoelastic behaviour, and that the linear viscoelastic range in
strain rate was approximately 1 \% at a temperature of 20 °C and a
frequency of 1 s-1 for all tested samples. Frequency sweeps showed
that the elastic modulus dominates the viscous modulus within the
LVE range for all three samples. Linear viscoelastic range and
dynamic yield point were found to be temperature and frequency
dependent. The properties of the different samples were found to not
change monotonically with frequency or temperature. Results of
experiments performed on a model water based drilling fluid conclude
that time of rest had little influence on the properties even for longer
period of rest. A slight increase in viscosity was observed for longer
rest periods.},

  abstract = {The study of stratified solid liquid annular flows is of great interest of the petroleum engineering, specifically in the drilling area. This kind of flow describes the phenomena involved in the transport of the solids generated by the bit during the drilling of a horizontal or highly inclined well. In these operations there is tendency. due to the action of gravitational forces, of solids deposition in the lower part of the annular region formed by the wellbore walls and the drill column. One approach is the well known Two Layer Model, originally proposed by the mining industry to simulate the transport of solids at high concentrations in pipes. This model has been adapted to the problem of drilled cuttings transport, by the introduction of elements to model the non Newtonian behavior of the fluid and the annular geometry and is currently in use for design and troubleshooting in drilling operations. Some limitations of the model in the reprodttction of the role of rheology in the transport of solids motivated the formulation of more precise hypothesis. This paper deals with the analysis of the effect of the improvements in the final results of the model. Such improvements include the experimental determination of interfacial friction between the solids bed and the suspension. new criteria for solid liquid slip conditions and the choice of different rheological models.},

Eleven water-based drilling fluids were formulated and chemically characterized in order to carry out the rheological evaluation. Dynamic experimental tests considering the non-Newtonian behaviour of such HTDFS were performed using a coaxial cylinder-type viscometer (Fann 50C). Drilling fluid viscosities in a programmed temperature range of 25-180 °C (at a constant reservoir pressure and a shear rate of 3448.2 kPa and 170 s-1, respectively) were measured. These dynamic viscosity measurements were then fitted to derive correlating equations for determining the drilling fluid viscosity as a function of temperature.

  abstract = {The research presented in this thesis is concerned with the development of numerical techniques and mathematical models for non-Newtonian fluids and two-phase flows in pipes and channels. Single phase, turbulent flow calculations of non-Newtonian fluids were performed initially. Based on the literature a revised approach to wall modelling is proposed and implemented. The approach uses analytical and experimental analyses of the turbulent boundary layer structure. A comparison with the standard approach is presented. The interaction between turbulence and non-Newtonian behaviour is studied by examining the rate of strain induced by fluctuating components of velocity. The statistical analysis of published DNS data is performed. Fi- nally, a model is proposed where the turbulent rate of strain is determined from turbulence quantities used by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model and used in the calculation of molecular viscosity. For two-phase flow, the solution procedure using periodic boundary conditions was developed under an assumption of a flat interface. The numerical technique was verified by comparing to an analytical result obtained for laminar flow in a channel. An extension to three dimensional flow is performed. With periodic boundary conditions standard turbulence models are applied to two-phase stratified flow. Several models and their corrections for two-phase flow are assessed and a new model is proposed. The numerical studies were carried out primiarily in the open-source code OpenFOAM, but initial attempts were made in commercial packages such as STAR-CD and FLUENT. Experimental data collected from the literature are used to verify the results showing good agreement in pressure drops and phase fractions.},

  abstract = {Cuttings transport has been a topic of research for many years. It has been observed that drilling fluids with similar properties according to the API standard can have significantly different behaviour with respect to the efficiency of cuttings transport. Oil based drilling fluids have been considered to be superior to water based drilling fluids when it comes to the hole cleaning, even if the fluid properties are equal as measured in accordance with API specifications. Despite this well-known fact, very limited studies are available in the literature to address this issue. Experimental studies with various oil-based drilling fluids and water-based drilling fluids were conducted in a 10m long flow loop under identical and controlled conditions. Further to understand the physics behind the observed differences in the cuttings transport efficiency, we have developed an Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model using commercial software ANSYS FLUENT. Experimental values from the flow loop experiments are compared with the CFD model results. CFD model helps to fill the gap in the results, which could not be obtained using experiments. The experimental results confirm that the annular frictional pressure loss in a fully eccentric annulus are significantly lesser than the values predicted by using models available in the literature for concentric annulus. CFD model includes realistic conditions like eccentric annulus and flow velocities. CFD model is used to conduct simulations for a wide range of parameters and the obtained results will be used to develop improved correlations for the prediction of cuttings transport.},

  abstract = {Rheological analysis provides a good comprehension of the
deformation and flow of substances under different stress conditions.
The complex composition of the drilling fluid and the versatile
functions makes rheological studies here indispensable as well as in
other scientific fields like the food industry and material science. In
spite of adding many high-quality additives to the drilling fluids,
problems still occur, such as barite-sag, lost circulation, change of mud
properties (particularly at high and very low temperature), solids
transport. Others are often mentioned as reasons for increasing the cost
of wells. The areas in which rheology plays an important role in
drilling technology will be highlighted in this article. The reason, why
the characterization with the Fann-viscometer alone is not enough for a
detailed view on rheology will be focused on. In addition, measuring
methods which are able to provide detailed information about gel
strength, consistency, gel destruction, gel build up process and yield
point have been investigated. A short overview of the basics of
rheology is given. In this article, novel procedures will be shown on
the basis of flow curve, hysteresis loops, amplitude sweep and 3-
interval-thixotropy-test (3ITT). With these procedures, deeper
knowledge about the drilling fluid system can be obtained.
Implementing these procedures and considering their results in
hydraulic calculation programs or taking them into account by the
design of drilling fluids, can reduce costs and lead to safer drilling
process in general.},

  abstract = {Abstract
A nonlinear rheological model which accounts for the time-dependent elastic, viscous and yielding phenomena is developed in order to describe the flow behavior of thixotropic materials which exhibit yield stress. A key feature of the formulation is a smooth transition from an ‘elastically’ dominated response to a ‘viscous’ response without a discontinuity in the stress–strain curve. The model is phenomenological and is based on the kinetic processes responsible for structural changes within the thixotropic material. As such, it can predict thixotropic effects, such as stress overshoot during start-up of a steady shear flow and stress relaxation after cessation of flow. Thus this model extends a previously proposed viscoplastic model [J. Rheol. 34 (1991) 647] to include thixotropy. An analysis and comparison to experimental data involving oscillatory shear flow are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the model and to estimate the model parameters in a prototype concentrated suspension. The experiments were conducted using a series of concentrated suspensions of silicon particles and silicon carbide whiskers in polyethylene. The data obtained with this experimental system indicated much better agreement between the theory and experiments that obtained in earlier work.},

We measure the sedimenting velocity of rigid spheres in power-law fluids. By imposing a controlled rotation, we can increase the typical shear rate in the surrounding fluid leading to a decrease of the effective fluid viscosity and, consequently, an increase of the sedimentation speed of the spheres. By fitting our experimental measurements to a power-law dependence of the sedimentation speed on the rotation frequency we are able to predict the values of the consistency and power indices for the test fluids. This setup could thus be used as a rheometer for power-law fluids.},

Forms AI, AII and AIII were stable between pH 3.0 and 5.5, and had pH optima for CBZ-Glu-Phe at 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9, respectively. These activities were rapidly lost on heating above 60 degrees. Their isoelectric points were at 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9, and the Michaelis constants for CBZ-Glu-Phe were calculated as 10, 6.6, and 4.2 X 10(-4)M, respectively. Activity was inhibited by Ag+, Au3+, Hg2+, iodine, and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), toluenesuffonyl fluoride (TSF), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were inhibitory at a concentration of 10(-3)M. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition. No distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively). In immuno-diffusion analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA, dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern. After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line. This suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces. This conclusion is supported by results obtained by poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS.},

The adapted animals' RQ in thermoneutral conditions was shown to be a little higher than in the control rats; 0.5 mg/kg noradrenaline injections induced a clear RQ decrease in the former and did not influence the latters' RQ. Cold exposure was followed by a RQ decrease in both. Ganglion blocking agent administration decreased the RQ in the adapted animals and prevented it from falling in the control those.

  issn = {0091-6749},
  abstract = {A nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system has been demonstrated in the guinea pig trachea. Electrical field stimulation of this system, in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine. The relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin, which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation. The gastrointestinal tract, which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract, also has a nonadrenergic inhibitory system. In the gastrointestinal tract, this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis, and absence of this system, in the colon and the rectum, is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in Hirschsprung's disease. It is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory nonadrenergic inhibitory system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreactive airways in asthma. The airways, due to a lack of inhibition, may be either partially contracted or unable to relax, and thus appear hyperreactive to stimuli.},

The appearance of a slip velocity at the wall critically affects wall stresses and flow profiles, and particularly the total flowrate. In this work we show, through numerical simulations and experiments, that the global slip phenomenon at a wall has peculiar features which deviate significantly from simple sliding behavior. At first we present experimental data for the vertical chute flow which highlight that wall slip depends on many operating and system variables such as flow rate, material properties, wall properties. Secondly, we resume a large campaign of numerical data performed in 2D with polygonal particles, and try to analyse the effect of material properties, contact parameters, operating variables, different flow configurations, on the slip phenomenon. The numerical campaign allowed to identify the main parameters affecting the wall slip behavior of a numerical model of granular flow, providing the ingredients for the creation of a framework for the description of wall slip.},

  abstract = {Whether viscosity or elasticity is more important for proppant suspending in fracturing fluids is a long standing controversial issue. In this study, the contributions of viscosity and elasticity to proppant suspending are quantified and decoupled for the first time for a model hydraulic fracturing fluid Carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar gel (CMHPG) cross-linked with borate. This is achieved by measuring the settling velocity of a single particle under shear flow in a transparent Couette flow cell using a CCD camera and an automatic particle tracking software. In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms of proppant suspending, the rheological behavior and possible flow instabilities were also monitored and the local flow field was mapped using particle tracking velocimetry. In the borate crosslinked CMHPG gel, the particle settling slows down with the increase in the imposed shear rate and the settling essentially stops at sufficiently high shear rates. The settling velocity data and rheological results suggest that there are two main mechanisms for the enhanced particle suspending under shear: shear thickening and elastic lifting. The relative importance of the two factors depends on the shear rate and fluid relaxation time. Specifically, the ratio of the elastic and viscous contribution to particle suspending is related to the product of fluid relaxation time and first normal stress difference divided by the shear viscosity. For the crosslinked CMHPG gel studied here, it is determined the viscosity is more important at shear rates smaller than 2 s-1 whereas the elasticity becomes dominant at shear rates larger than 2 s-1. The elucidation of the relative importance of viscosity and elasticity provides valuable guidance in optimizing fracture fluid design to maximize its proppant transport power. For example, depending on the well condition and fluid type, one may wish to optimize either the viscosity or elasticity of a fracturing fluid to maximize proppant transport into fractures.},

The examples given illustrate that proppant settling during fracture closure can be important in the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment. Field data illustrate the time required for fracture closure.

The computer program which models the fracturing process uses proppant settling velocities obtained from extensive laboratory data collected under simulated fracturing conditions. Proppant settling predictions include the effects of non-Newtonian fluids, concentrated slurries of proppant, fracture walls, and changes in fluid temperatures along the fracture. These substantially affect the settling velocity of the proppant and must be considered to obtain a realistic prediction of proppant transport.},

  title = {Non-Standard Geomtries for Rheological Characterization of Complex Fluids},
  url = {http://www.tainst.com},
  abstract = {Traditional rotational rheometry has been dealing with
ideal flow conditions (viscometric flows) using plateplate,
cone-plate or concentric cylinder geometries to
characterize complex materials, preferably in the linear
viscoelastic region.
Complex fluids, however are often difficult to measure
under these conditions. Sedimentation during testing or
slippage at the sample-tool interface have a significant
effect on the results and reduce the operation range of
the instruments.
Furthermore do viscoelastic flows by no means
represent the real flow situation in batch or continuous
reactors and processing machines during mixing and/or
incorporation of additives, etc. For example, in order
to simulate and to understand the gelatinization of starch,
a mixing element is used as the standard geometry to
avoid settling of the non soluble starch particles since
the early days of rheological testing.
Many complex fluids can be tested using the
rheometer as an instrumented batch reactor with
different types of mixing elements to measure under real
flow conditions (systemic rheology =$>$ the rheology of
the system including material and environment) while
even conducting complementary measurements, for
example conductivity measurements.
Since the flow is complex and the material behaves
usually non-linear, the calculation of a true or
representative deformation or deformation rate for the
mixing element is an issue. Based on a Couette analogy,
average deformation and stress coefficients can be determined which relate the motor rotation speed to
the material deformation rate and the measured torque
to the stress.},

In particular, we present an analysis of the steady-states of the model that yields important considerations for drilling practitioners.

The model parameters A, B, and C, are calculated using the Golden Section Search Method. The pressure drop equation derived by Aswad and Saleh, in terms of the model parameters, has been used for laminar flow. For turbulent flow, a new friction factor correlation is proposed, which represents a generalization of the Caetano et al. equation for Newtonian fluids. In addition to the present data bank, used in the development of the proposed friction factor, another set of data from the Middle East are used for comparison purposes. It is observed based on statistical results that the laminar and turbulent flow equations described by the Robertson-Stiff model show excellent results and clearly outperform the two popular models, the Bingham plastic and the power law.},

  abstract = {Slip occurs in the flow of two-phase systems because of the displacement of the disperse phase away from solid boundaries. This arises from steric, hydrodynamic, viscoelastic and chemical forces and constraints acting on the disperse phase immediately adjacent to the walls. The enrichment of the boundary near the wall with the continuous (and usually low-viscosity) phase means that any flow of the fluid over the boundary is easier because of the lubrication effect. Because this effect is usually confined to a very narrow layer — with typical thickness of 0.1–10 μm—it so resembles the slip of solids over surfaces that it has historically been given the same terminology. The restoring force for all the forces that cause an increase in concentration is usually osmotic, and this will always limit the effective slip. In dilute systems, concentration gradients can be present over relatively large distances out from walls, giving what might be interpreted on an overall basis as a thick solvent-only layer. However, as the concentration of the system increases, the layer gets thinner and thinner because it is more difficult to create with the large reverse osmotic force present. However, the enormous increase in the bulk viscosity with increase in concentration means that although thinner, the layer becomes, paradoxically, even more important. Slip manifests itself in such a way that viscosity measured in different size geometries gives different answers if calculated the normal way — in particular the apparent viscosity decreases with decrease in geometry size (e.g. tube radius). Also, in single flow curves unexpected lower Newtonian plateaus are sometimes seen, with an apparent yield stress at even lower stresses. Sudden breaks in the flow curve can also be seen. Large particles as the disperse phase (remember flocs are large particles), with a large dependence of viscosity on the concentration of the dispersed phase are the circumstances which can give slip, especially if coupled with smooth walls and small flow dimensions. The effect is usually greatest at low speeds/flow rates. When the viscometer walls and particles carry like electrostatic charges and the continuous phase is electrically conducted, slip can be assumed. In many cases we need to characterise the slip effects seen in viscometers because they will also be seen in flow in smooth pipes and condults in manufacturing plants. This is usually done by relating the wall shear stress to a slip velocity using a power-law relationship. When the bulk flow has also been characterized, the flow in real situations can be calculated. To characterise slip, it is necessary to change the size of the geometry, and the results extrapolated to very large size to extract unambigouos bulk-flow and slip data respectively. A number of mathematical manipulations are necessary to retrieve these data. We can make attempts to eliminate slip by altering the physical or chemical character of the walls. This is usually done physically by roughening or profiling, but in the extreme, a vane can be used. This latter geometry has the advantage of being easy to make and clean. In either case—by extrapolation or elimination—we end up with the bulk flow properties. This is important in situations where we are trying to understand the microstructure/flow interactions.},

  abstract = {Anisotropic particles are common in many industrial and natural turbulent flows. When these particles are small and neutrally buoyant, they follow Lagrangian trajectories while exhibiting rich orientational dynamics from the coupling of their rotation to the velocity gradients of the turbulence field. This system has proven to be a fascinating application of the fundamental properties of velocity gradients in turbulence. When particles are not neutrally buoyant, they experience preferential concentration and very different preferential alignment than neutrally buoyant tracer particles. A vast proportion of the parameter range of anisotropic particles in turbulence is still unexplored, with most existing research focusing on the simple foundational cases of axisymmetric ellipsoids at low concentrations in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and in turbulent channel flow. Numerical simulations and experiments have recently developed a fairly comprehensive picture of alignment and rotation in these cases, and they provide an essential foundation for addressing more complex problems of practical importance. Macroscopic effects of nonspherical particle dynamics include preferential concentration in coherent structures and drag reduction by fiber suspensions. We review the models used to describe nonspherical particle motion, along with numerical and experimental methods for measuring particle dynamics.},

  abstract = {This study aims to improve the predictive capabilities of flow pattern and depositional behaviour of non-Newtonian, high concentration sand and fines mixtures. The depositional behaviour influences the geometry of the deposit and the distribution of sand and fines particles, which in turn influence the strength and consolidation performance of the deposit. Ultimately this affects the area reclamation targets from the mining industry. In this study an existing numerical model, Delft3D (a three-dimensional, open source flow model from Deltares utilized world-wide in various hydrodynamic and sediment transport studies), is extended with the physics that describe non-Newtonian rheology and sand settling in shear flow. The rheology determines the yield stress and viscosity of a fluid. Shear induced sand settling occurs for fluids with a yield stress. Sand settles under shear whereas smaller particles stay suspended, producing segregation. Segregation leads to non-uniformity in deposit composition (e.g sand and fines dominated areas). Rheology and sand settling mutually interact, directly influencing deposition patterns. This study is a continuation of the work of [Hanssen, 2016], who included specific rheology and sand settling formulation in a one-dimensional version of Delft3D (i.e. 1DV). As part of this work, further verification of this one-dimensional model has been performed and the model has been extended to two-dimensional vertical (i.e. 2DV in a longitudinal cross section). The extended model has been tested in 2DV with deposition over a 400 meters slope. A sensitivity analysis is performed to consider the effect of different solid contents and rheological properties. The model is also tested on specific oil sand applications and data, such as tailings deposition down a beach, mutual interaction of tailings with different rheology or strength and a characterization of fines capture compared with data. This study proved that the extended version of Delft3D can simulate a 2DV non-Newtonian high density flow including sand settling. However there are still some physical processes where the model needs improvements or further research is needed, such as laminar-turbulence regime; transition to 3D and the motion of sand layers. Further model verification and development goes hands in hands with a good data set. Specifically important are flume/field tests with rheology data and its variation with time, especially for polymer added tailings, to verify the model.},

The model is based on a viscous mechanism of drag reduction, in which either extended polymers or non-Brownian fibers increase the extensional viscosity of the fluid and thereby suppress both small and large turbulent eddies and reduce momentum transfer to the wall, resulting in drag reduction. Our model provides a rheological interpretation of the upward parallel shift S+ in the mean velocity profile upon addition of polymer, observed by Virk. We show that Virk's correlations for the dependence on polymer molecular weight and concentration of the onset wall shear stress and slope increment on the Prandtl-Karman plot can be translated to two dimensionless numbers, namely an onset Weissenberg number and an asymptotic Trouton ratio of maximum extensional viscosity to zero-shear viscosity. We believe that our model, while simple, captures the essential features of drag reduction that are universal to flexible polymers and fibers, and, unlike the Virk phenomenology, can easily be extended to flows with inhomogeneous polymer or fiber concentration fields.},

  shorttitle = {{{SPE}}-15937-{{PA}}},
  abstract = {Summary. In hydraulic fracturing treatments, the success of the treatment strongly depends on the proper placement proppant particles in the fracture. "Proper placement" means the packing of the fracture to achieve maximum conductivity of gas/oil through the fracture into the wellbore. The placement of the proppants along the fracture is based on design equations where sand transport velocity is related to the rheological parameters of the fracturing fluid and characteristics of the proppant particle, such size and density. The present work describes the theoretical transport equations that take into account the elasticity of the fluid in predicting proppant settling rate in the fracture. It presents the rheological data of commonly used fracturing fluids (titanate and borate crosslinked), including viscous and elastic parameter measurements made with a Rheometrics Pressure Rheometer TM (RPR) and Rheometrics Mechanical Spectrometer TM (RMS-800). These data show some important differences between borate crosslinked gels and titanate crosslinked gels. The paper also presents experimental data of proppant settling rates in various fracturing fluids and how these can be correlated with rheological parameters obtained in this work. The difference in rheology between borate and titanate gels was correlated with the difference in settling rates of proppants in these two gels. The theoretical and experimental work presented here led to the conclusion that the model for proppant placement in a hydraulic fracture should include: (1) proppant characteristics, (2) viscous rheological parameters (K and n), (3) elastic parameters (complex dynamic viscosity) from linear viscoelastic constitutive equation, and (4) normal stress difference from nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive equation. The influence of crosslinked-polymer-gel network structure on proppant transport is also discussed. IntroductionThe sand transport in crosslinked fracturing gels is an important parameter that needs to he understood in terms of its relationship to fluid rheology and pumping parameters.

(The linear viscoelasticity results from a small deformation of polymer molecule; the nonlinear viscoelasticity results from a large deformation of polymer molecule.)

  abstract = {While shear thickening is a well-known feature of some polymer solutions, its observation in the absence of a clear specific chemical or structural mechanism and at very low rates of shear (shear rate ≤ 0.1/s) in our own data, as well as in several polymer systems in the literature, has prompted further investigation. Using the rheologically-reproducible and commercially available dysphagia product ResourceÒ Thicken Up Clear (produced by Nestle Health Science) as a canonical demonstration fluid, we show that the observation of a local maximum in the steady shear viscosity at very low shear rates can be completely attributed to the sample not having reached steady state conditions, and correspondingly, to the measurement not having been performed in steady simple shear flow. We propose two criteria to ensure equilibration during steady state flow rheological measurements: a substantial increase in the measurement time allotted for each point such that the total material strain accumulated in the sample is allowed to reach shear strain ≤ 5 and/or a stricter convergence criterion of 10 consecutive readings within a tolerance of 1\%.},

  abstract = {The problem of solids cleanout in horizontal wellbores was studied experimentally. The special case of drilling-fluid circulation with no inner-pipe rotation was considered. This case is similar to coiled tubing (CT) drilling in which frequent hole cleanout must be performed. Sand-sized cuttings (ranging from 260 to 1240 µm) were used. Critical velocity and wall shear stress required for starting bed erosion were measured. Water and viscous-polymer base fluids with three different polymer concentrations were used. Results have shown that water always starts cuttings movement at lower flow rates than polymer solutions. Fluids with higher polymer concentration (and higher viscosity) required higher flow rates to start eroding the bed. Critical wall shear stress was also determined from pressure-loss measurements. Analyzing the data revealed that water starts cuttings removal at lower pressure loss than more-viscous fluids. Higher-viscosity fluids always showed higher pressure loss at the start of bed erosion. For the range of cuttings size studied, results show that an intermediate cuttings size was slightly easier to remove. However, the impact of cuttings size was far less than that of fluid rheology. Overall cuttings size was found to have a small impact on hole cleaning. Dimensionless analysis of parameters relevant to the process of cuttings movement was performed. It was shown that dimensionless wall shear stress (in the forms of Shields’ stress and also ratio of shear velocity to settling velocity) at the onset of bed erosion correlated well with particle Reynolds number. On the basis of this finding, two correlations were developed to predict critical wall shear stress. A procedure was developed to calculate critical flow rate as well. Friction-factor data for the flow through the annulus with a stationary cuttings bed are also reported.},

  abstract = {It is essential to transport cuttings generated in drilling operations to the surface for disposal. As the inclination of wellbore increases, cuttings begin to deposit in the lower section of the wellbore, and develop cuttings bed. This developed bed increases the mechanical friction between the drillstring and the wellbore. As a result, problems such as increase in torque, decrease in force transfer to the bit, and poor control of the bottom hole pressure arise. Estimation of total concentration of cuttings inside the wellbore has never been an easy task. Cuttings and fluid dragging them to be transported have different relative velocities inside the wellbore, causing variations in pressure drop. Hence, a better understanding in cuttings–liquid interactions inside the wellbore is required.In this study, the interactions between cuttings and drilling fluid in horizontal eccentric annulus were simulated and observed using commercial Computational Fluid. CFD software program has proven to be a successful tool in studying complex fluid mechanic problems that are difficult to solve analytically. The effect of fluid flow rate and the impact of the rate of penetration (ROP) on flow patterns, cuttings concentration and pressure losses were investigated and validated using data obtained from Middle East Technical University Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering Department Cuttings Transport / Multiphase Flow Loop. The drilling fluid of study is limited to water, a Newtonian fluid. The results obtained from the simulations show good agreement with the experiments. As the drilling fluid flow rate increases, the flow pattern was observed changing from stationary bed to dispersed flow, which complies with experimental results and literature findings. Increase in flow rate overcomes the gravitational force that pulls the cuttings downward and increases the surface forces that lift the cuttings up to the surface. Consequently, by increasing annular flow rate, cuttings concentration is decreased. On the other hand, the increment in ROP leads to more cuttings generated and more cuttings accumulation in the well bore. In conclusion, fluid flow rate and ROP are both significant factors in hole cleaning operations. The higher the flow rate, the higher the efficiency of hole cleaning, whereas the higher the ROP, the less efficient is the hole cleaning. CFD is proven to be successfully applied to predict the solid concentration in the well. Therefore this tool can be used for more complex cases, and the information provides can be very useful especially when there is no any other data available.},

This paper describes theoretical and experimental analyses that account for viscous and elastic properties of the fluid to predict proppant settling characteristics and properties of the fluid to predict proppant settling characteristics and reviews existing theoretical models used to correlate proppant settling data. A closed-form expression for the terminal settling velocity of a single particle as derived from an approximate analysis is compared with experimental data and with data from the literature. The theoretical results are combined with the experimental data to obtain a correlation that is useful in the prediction of the settling velocity of a particle in viscous fluids at an intermediate Reynolds number.},

  doi = {10.1017/S0022112081000736},
  abstract = {The stress tensor in a granular shear flow is calculated by supposing that binary collisions between the particles comprising the granular mass are responsible for most of the momentum transport. We assume that the particles are smooth, hard, elastic spheres and express the stress as an integral containing probability distribution functions for the velocities of the particles and for their spatial arrangement. By assuming that the single-particle velocity distribution function is Maxwellian and that the spatial pair distribution function is given by a formula due to Carnahan \&amp; Starling, we reduce this integral to one depending upon a single non-dimensional parameter R: the ratio of the characteristic mean shear velocity to the root mean square of the precollisional particle-velocity perturbation. The integral is evaluated asymptotically for R [Gt      ] 1 and R [Lt      ] 1 and numerically for intermediate values. Good agreement is found between the stresses measured in experiments on dry granular materials and the theoretical predictions when R is given the value 1·7. This case is probably the one for which the present analysis is most appropriate. For moderate and large values of R, the theory predicts both shear and normal stresses that are proportional to the square of the particle diameter and the square of the shear rate, and depend strongly on the solids volume fraction. A provisional comparison is made between the stresses predicted in the limit R → ∞ and the experimental results of Bagnold for shear flow of neutrally buoyant wax spheres suspended in water. The predicted stresses are of the correct order of magnitude and yield the proper variation of stress with concentration. When R [Lt      ] 1, the shear stress is linear in the shear rate, and the analysis can be applied to shear flow in a fluidized bed, although such an application is not developed further here.},

  abstract = {The flow of an idealized granular material consisting of uniform smooth, but nelastic, spherical particles is studied using statistical methods analogous to those used in the kinetic theory of gases. Two theories are developed: one for the Couette flow of particles having arbitrary coefficients of restitution (inelastic particles) and a second for the general flow of particles with coefficients of restitution near 1 (slightly inelastic particles). The study of inelastic particles in Couette flow follows the method of Savage \&amp; Jeffrey (1981) and uses an ad hoc distribution function to describe the collisions between particles. The results of this first analysis are compared with other theories of granular flow, with the Chapman-Enskog dense-gas theory, and with experiments. The theory agrees moderately well with experimental data and it is found that the asymptotic analysis of Jenkins \&amp; Savage (1983), which was developed for slightly inelastic particles, surprisingly gives results similar to the first theory even for highly inelastic particles. Therefore the ‘nearly elastic’ approximation is pursued as a second theory using an approach that is closer to the established methods of Chapman-Enskog gas theory. The new approach which determines the collisional distribution functions by a rational approximation scheme, is applicable to general flowfields, not just simple shear. It incorporates kinetic as well as collisional contributions to the constitutive equations for stress and energy flux and is thus appropriate for dilute as well as dense concentrations of solids. When the collisional contributions are dominant, it predicts stresses similar to the first analysis for the simple shear case.},

  url = {http://mech.vub.ac.be/thermodynamics/phd/PhD_thesis_Patryk_Widera.pdf},
  abstract = {Sedimentation processes play a crucial role in human environment. Numerous
examples of sediment transport and sedimentation problems can
be given, e.g. unwanted dust in our living areas, dust in electronic devices,
problems with deposition efficiency of inhaled medicines, problems with
uncontrolled sand transport in rivers or with transport of any kind of pollutants
in water or in the air and industrial examples as pneumatic transport
or cyclone separation. Contemporary knowledge about the processes
that are involved in the particle transport, in the inter-particle or fluidparticle
coupling is still very small. The prediction of sediment behavior
in industrial calculations usually is based on simple, empirical formulas,
which are applicable only for simple and very specific cases. Even with
such an approach, the error of the prediction of sediment concentration
can reach dozens or hundreds of percents. The sediment concentration error
can be even bigger in large areas as lakes, rivers or harbors, where the
amount of variables influencing the sediment transport is larger and less
predictable.
However, the improvement of the numerical methods and computing power
raise a distinct possibility to develop more advanced models that can give
the solution to sediment transport issue in a relatively short time with
reasonably high accuracy. The increasing computational power allows to
use such methodologies as, e.g. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) in order to try to investigate the patterns
of sediment transport in turbulent flows. Unsteady simulations give the
opportunity to investigate particle behavior on the smallest scales, which
is necessary to understand the physics of particle movement and particle
response to turbulent fluid motions.
The main goal of this thesis is to develop an efficient numerical algorithm
to simulate sediment transport in the presence of turbulent flows.
The current study is based on the LES approach, where advanced subgrid
scale models are used to capture small scales of unsteady turbulent
flows, i.e. the Smagorinsky and the WALE (Wall-Adapting Local Eddy)
based models. In most of the considered cases the dilute flow assumption
is applied, i.e. the sediment concentration is small enough to consider its
influence to flow field as negligible. The only exception is the study presented
in Chapter 8, where the sediment phase is coupled with the fluid
phase using the varying viscosity and settling velocity model. In case when dilute flow is considered, the sediment concentration profiles are validated
against the theoretical curve calculated based on the Rouse equation.
As first, the sediment transport in an open and closed channel with smooth
walls was studied. The results presented in Chapter 5 show good agreement
of the LES based sediment concentration when compared to the theoretical
curve. Additionally, it is shown that the RANS solution can be improved
when the turbulent Schmidt number is defined based on the LES
solution, when dilute flow condition is assumed.
In Chapter 6, the study of the sediment transport in the rough bottom
channel is presented. The LES solution obtained from the rough bottom
simulations were used to study the sediment transport patterns and also
served as reference data for development of the two-equation turbulence
model in Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes framework, see Heredia [55].
The basic, classical sediment-fluid coupling models are studied and described
in Chapter 8. The coupling between fluid and sediment is based
on the varying viscosity and varying settling model, i.e. model of Toda
and Hisamoto [131] and Van Rijn [148], respectively. As it was expected,
obtained results confirmed that even a relatively small amount of the sediment
particles (in this case the volumetric concentration is 1 and 2\%) can
influence the flow field. It is also confirmed that the small particles influence
the flow field less, when compared to the influence of bigger particles,
assuming the same volumetric concentration.
Chapter 9 presents the study of the slip velocity models proposed by Manninen
et al. [84]. As has been proved, the velocity and the pressure based
models significantly improve solution accuracy of the Eulerian model for
large particles, especially in the developed flow region. However, it is found
that neglecting the turbulent and the viscous stresses results in low accuracy
in the wall vicinity. Hence, it is suggested that the near wall properties
of both models should be further investigated. Additionally, a simple
correction method for the pressure based model is presented.
As has been shown in the study, the applied methodology, i.e. sediment
transport using LES, can give a very detailed picture of the sediment behavior,
including sediment concentration, its response to the turbulent
fluctuations and sediment transport patterns. Nevertheless, to recognize
results of numerical simulations as fully correct, they should also be validated
against experimental results. That still seems to be an unresolved
problem in some cases, e.g. flows with high concentration of particles.},

  doi = {10.2118/77960-PA},
  abstract = {Summary This paper presents a complete set of friction-factor correlations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in laminar and turbulent flow in coiled tubing. The friction-factor correlation for non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow is based on theoretical analysis and numerical solutions of the flow equations of a power-law-model fluid in curved pipes. The empirical correlation for non-Newtonian fluids in~turbulent flow is based on full-scale experiments of polymeric-fluid systems in various 1-, 1½-, and 2?-in. coiled-tubing reels. To consider the effect of pipe roughness in coiled tubing, a modified correlation is proposed by combining the Srinivasan et al. correlation (Srinivasan et al. 1970)~for smooth, curved pipe and the Chen correlation (Chen 1979) for rough, straight pipe. Examples are given to illustrate the applications and accuracies of the newly developed correlations. Introduction The friction factor in curved pipe at a given Reynolds number is greater than that in straight pipe because of the existence of secondary flow, which is caused by the effect of centrifugal forces in curved-flow geometry. Dean (1927, 1928) conducted the first theoretical study of Newtonian fluid flow in curved pipes by solving the momentum and continuity equations using a successive approximation method. A recent literature review indicates that the flow of Newtonian fluids in curved pipes has been studied extensively since the pioneering work of Dean (Zhou and Shah 2004). In contrast, the information on studies of non-Newtonian fluid flow in curved pipes is relatively scarce. Coiled tubing has been successfully used in the oil and gas industry for well drilling, completion, wellbore cleanout, stimulation, and other field operations. In these coiled-tubing applications, fluids—typically non-Newtonian—are generally pumped through the coiled tubing. Because of the small diameter and excessive friction loss caused by secondary flow, the maximum pumping rate obtainable is often limited. For engineering design purposes, correlations are needed to accurately predict the frictional pressure losses in the coiled-tubing string and the pumping power requirement. The present work is an effort to meet such needs by providing a complete set of friction-factor correlations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids under laminar- and turbulent-flow conditions. For non-Newtonian laminar flow, a new correlation is developed through the boundary-layer approximation analysis and by using the numerical solution of the flow equations of a power-law-model fluid in coiled tubing. The correlation is presented in an empirical form for convenience. For non-Newtonian turbulent flow, a new correlation is established on the basis of the recent experiments performed using a full-scale coiled-tubing flow test facility. A modified correlation for turbulent Newtonian fluid flow is also proposed to include the effect of pipe roughness. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the application of these new correlations and their accuracies in estimating friction factors of fluid flowing in coiled tubing.},

Experimental data is presented to show that elastic effects can increase or decrease the settling velocity of particles, even in the creeping flow regime. Experimental data shows that a significant drag reduction occurs with increase in Weissenberg number. This is followed by a transition to increasing drag at higher Weissenberg numbers. A new correlation is presented for the sphere settling velocity in unbounded viscoelastic fluids as a function of the fluid rheology and the proppant properties. The wall factors for sphere settling velocities in viscoelastic fluids confined between solid parallel plates are calculated from experimental measurements made on these fluids over a range of Weissenberg numbers. Results indicate that elasticity reduces the effect of the confining walls and this reduction is more pronounced at higher ratios of the particle diameter to spacing between the walls. Shear thinning behavior of fluids is observed to reduce the retardation effect of the confining walls. A new empirical correlation for wall factors for spheres settling in a viscoelastic fluid confined between two parallel walls is presented.},

  abstract = {AbstractExperimental data and analysis are presented on the static and dynamic settling of proppant in non-Newtonian hydraulic fracturing fluids. A unique High Pressure Simulator (HPS) that closely models reservoir hydraulic fractures is used to study proppant-settling behavior under both static and dynamic conditions. A system of optical fibers and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) acting as a vision system were imbedded in the platens representing fracture walls for quantification of proppant settling under various fluid injection conditions. Hydraulic fracturing fluids tested include slurries of 35 lb/Mgal guar linear gel with 6 ppg 20/40 mesh sand, 60 and 40 lb/ Mgal hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) linear gels both with 4 ppg 20/40 mesh sand, and borate-crosslinked 35 lb/Mgal guar gel with 7.3 ppg 20/40 mesh sand. Test conditions cover a shear rate range of 60 to 120 sec-1. In addition, the effect of an enzyme breaker on proppant settling rate under static conditions was studied. Tests were conducted with a fracture gap width of 0.375 in. under ambient conditions. Analysis of the dynamic condition indicates that proppant settling within the linear and crosslinked gels investigated is non-linearly dependent on shear rate. Under static conditions, linear gel slurries settled 40 to 50 times faster than the crosslinked gel containing breaker. It is also shown that an increase in shear rate induces proppant settling in borate-crosslinked 35 lb/Mgal guar gel while it reduces the settling rate in 35 lb/Mgal guar linear gel. IntroductionWhen a particle settles in a given fluid and its fall is not affected by the boundaries of the container or by the presence of other surrounding particles, the process is referred to as "free settling" or "single particle settling". However, when the particles are near each other (in the form of a slurry), the motion of one particle is greatly influenced by the presence of other particles. This process is called "hindered settling". Particle settling occurs when the gravity vector is greater than the forces contributing to particle suspension. However, the forces that contribute to particle suspension decrease as the fluid moves through surface equipment and downhole through tubing at high shear rates. The reduction in suspending ability occurs as the result of the thermal and shear history effects experienced by the fluid. Within the fractures, the gravity vector becomes dominant and particle settling begins to occur. The build up of settled particles along the bottom of the fracture causes a restriction to flow. As a result of settling, the area open to flow above the bed reduces and therefore, fluid velocity increases across the top of the sand dune. This makes the fluid, again, capable of re-suspending and moving the proppant while proppant deposition stops. This stage is called bed height equilibrium. It is important to note that at equilibrium conditions, fluid is capable of re-suspending and transporting proppant at the same rate that proppant settles. The settling rate, therefore, equals the transport rate and hence equilibrium occurs. Particle settling is an important issue in hydraulic fracturing because the expected improvement in productivity of a well after hydraulic fracturing depends mainly on the fracture length and fracture conductivity, both of which depend on proppant settling. The complexity of measuring proppant settling in multi-particle environment has been simplified by measuring single particle settling velocity. Measurement of single particle settling velocities in Newtonian fluids is simple and straightforward. This is due to the properties of these fluids, which state that viscosity is independent of shear rate.},

  abstract = {Abstract Prediction of proppant transport is important in both treatment design and post-treatment analysis. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in proppant transport as evidenced by the number of papers presented at SPE meetings. There are a number of factors that have been overlooked in these papers that we believe are of primary importance. This paper summarizes the work that has been done in the area of proppant transport in settling and non-settling fluids. We also present the results of analyzing convection in turbulent flow fracturing treatments. Introduction Since proppants were first used in hydraulic fracturing, the question of proppant placement in the fracture has remained, for the most part, unanswered. Prediction of proppant placement is important in fracturing treatment design and post treatment analysis and research work reported over the years has contributed greatly to our understanding of the proppant transport process. In this paper we will cover the major modes of transport and discuss the influence of fracture geometry on proppant placement. The Transport Process Thinking about proppant placement has been strongly influenced by assumptions made about fracture geometry. Early theoretical work on fracture geometry yielded a picture of fractures that were elliptical from top-to-bottom or end-to-end with a relatively well-bounded top and bottom. This led to a view of fractures with parallel or nearly parallel sides and a rectangular shape. Experimental proppant transport models were and still are, for the most part, based on these ideas. In many ways, it is the only practical approach to model building. As we will see, it can lead to rather naive view of the placement process. The taxonomy of proppant transport starts with a division of the process into two major groups based on fluid properties: non-crosslinked fluids where particle settling can be important and crosslinked fluids where it is not. Early proppant transport studies were primarily concerned with fluids in which it was thought that settling strongly influenced proppant placement. As in other areas of fracturing, work done by Perkin and Kern1 laid the groundwork for understanding proppant transport in non-crosslinked fluids and served as a basis for a number of later experimental models. The accepted view of proppant transport in fluids in which particle settling occurs at a significant rate is that settling is governed by Stokes type particle settling velocity, proppant concentration, and the fluid velocity in the fracture. Particles enter the fracture and are transported uniformly away from the entry point until they are deposited on the bottom of the fracture. Deposition results in the buildup in a bank of proppant that is limited in height by the velocity of the fluid across the top of the bank. Because the proppant bank is the most prominent feature of proppant transport by non-crosslinked fluids, these fluids are often referred to as ``bank-building fluids.'' With crosslinked fluids, settling is not an issue. The proppant goes with the fluid. And thus, there are two distinct general transport mechanisms. We will begin with crosslinked fluids because transport in these systems is, in many ways, simpler. Crosslinked Fluids In transport by crosslinked or non-crosslinked fluids, the first thing to remember is — nature is lazy. The fluids will always take the easiest route through the fracture. And with crosslinked fluids, the proppant goes where the fluid goes. There are two distinct wellbore configurations that have an influence on the final proppant distribution. If the perforated interval is short relative to the fracture height, flow into the fracture can be considered to be flow from a point source. While a more even distribution of perforations relative to the fracture height will provide a more uniform slurry distribution from top to bottom. Depending upon the number and location of perforations that actually accept fluid, local point source flows can be expected to influence the proppant distribution.},

The test apparatus consists of a1/2 x 8-in. [1.3 x 20.3-cm] rectangular slot 14 1/2 ft [4.4 m] high, faced withPlexiglas (TM) and equipped with pressure taps at 1-ft [0.3-m] intervals.

Sand loadings of 2 to 15 lbm/gal [240 to1797 kg/m3] (8 to 40 vol\% of solids) were tested.

Introduction The problem of particle or proppant settling in hydraulic fracturingoperations is of great importance. Knowledge of proppant-settling velocity isnecessary for prediction of the proppant-settling velocity is necessary forprediction of the final proppant distribution in the fracture. A thoroughunderstanding of proppant transport aids in designing fracturing treatments toobtain more effective proppant distribution. During a hydraulic fracturingprocess, some fluid is lost to the formation, thus increasing the proppantconcentration of the slurry pumped. Proppant settling in slurries is a verycomplex phenomenon compared with single-particle settling in a fluid.phenomenon compared with single-particle settling in a fluid. Single-particlesettling in a non-Newtonian fluid in the fracture has been studied extensively.In contrast, very little literature exists that explains the complexhindered-settling effects of particles in non-Newtonian fracturing gels.Without adequate particles in non-Newtonian fracturing gels. Without adequatetheory for description of this phenomenon, most fracturing-design simulatorstoday use correlations for single-particle-settling velocities in fracturinggels, and from the theory of Newtonian suspensions or slurries, correct thesevelocities to account for the hindered settling effects. For example, from hisexperimental work with water and 35-cp [35-mPa] oil, Novotny suggested usingRichardson and Zaki's Newtonian-fluid correlations. Novotny demonstrated fromlimited experimental data that the correction for Newtonian-fluid hindranceeffects was also reasonably good for non-Newtonian fracturing gels. Novotnyalso reported that in some cases proppants agglomerated or clustered duringmeasurements of settling velocities of proppant-laden slurries flowing throughfractures. Kirkby and Rockefeller conducted static sedimentation experiments toevaluate the settling behavior of nonflowing slurries with thedifferential-pressure technique for measuring proppant concentration andsettling velocity in concentrated slurries. A proppant clustering phenomenonoccurs in all fracturing gels at proppant clustering phenomenon occurs in allfracturing gels at typical proppant concentrations, resulting in average staticslurry-settling velocities that are considerably greater than those of singleparticles. Dunand and Soucemarianadin used viscometric measurements to studysedimentation of single particles and suspensions in static HPG fracturingfluids. They showed that the viscosity function of these fluids can bepresented by the Ellis model and that theoretical predictions andexperimentally measured velocities of single particles agree well. Using gammaray attenuation measurements, Dunand and Soucemarianadin studied the settlingbehavior of concentrated proppant suspensions. They claimed that, in fluidswith identical single particle-settling velocities, the average settling rateof a concentrated suspension in a static non-Newtonian fluid is two to threetimes higher than in a corresponding Newtonian fluid. These two studies triedto answer some of the questions related to proppant settling in fracturing gelsin a multiparticle environment. Despite the contributions of these and otherauthors, however, further investigation is needed to understand this complexphenomenon fully. Therefore, an experimental study was undertaketo phenomenonfully. Therefore, an experimental study was undertaketo explain the complexphenomenon of particle settling in fracturing slurries. The objectives of thisinvestigation are two-fold: (1) to design and build a large-scale testingapparatus for simulating the behavior of proppant-laden fluids in a fractureand (2) to report observations of proppant settling in the presence of multipleparticles in controlled test conditions. Preliminary findings of particles incontrolled test conditions. Preliminary findings of sedimentation experimentswith various fluid systems also are reported.

  abstract = {Introduction

It is almost certain that problems will occur while drilling a well, even in very carefully planned wells. For example, in areas in which similar drilling practices are used, hole problems may have been reported where no such problems existed previously because formations are nonhomogeneous. Therefore, two wells near each other may have totally different geological conditions.

In well planning, the key to achieving objectives successfully is to design drilling programs on the basis of anticipation of potential hole problems rather than on caution and containment. Drilling problems can be very costly. The most prevalent drilling problems include pipe sticking, lost circulation, hole deviation, pipe failures, borehole instability, mud contamination, formation damage, hole cleaning, H2S-bearing formation and shallow gas, and equipment and personnel-related problems.

Understanding and anticipating drilling problems, understanding their causes, and planning solutions are necessary for overall-well-cost control and for successfully reaching the target zone. This chapter addresses these problems, possible solutions, and, in some cases, preventive measures.},

  abstract = {Abstract APIT is a computational software based system which performs real-time test analysis, reporting and automated result interpretation of FITs/LOTs/XLOTs based on surface and downhole data. This paper presents the challenges for the current pressure integrity testing and introduced a new solution called automated pressure testing (APIT) system. This has included system framework and integration to cementing units, models and algorithms to determine system compliance and fluid leakage, fracture closure pressure, calibration techniques and validated results. Based on a minimum of preconfigured user input, the APIT system covers all test phases, from pressurization, fracture propagation to shut-in and flowback. The system identifies unexpected test behavior and triggers warnings by continuously evaluating key test metrics such as leakage rate, system compliance and surface pressure during each test phase. This APIT system was tested optimized and validated using various historical field data in order to provide Proof-of-Concept of algorithms, test sequences and graphics user interface (GUI). Both successful and unsuccessful data chosen from NCS and the international arena were tested. The automatic interpretation algorithms from APIT are aligned with manual test interpretation performed internally in Statoil. The APIT system is believed to be a safer and more efficient pressure testing alternative to the current manual counterpart.},

  abstract = {Abstract Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) enables safer operations and reduces non-productive time and thus provides the opportunity to reduce well costs. Many operators however, are not fully embracing the opportunity offered by the technology, due to strict regulatory requirements, and their perception that MPD is complicated and increases risk. A basis for this perception is that operator engineers in their designs, and contractor drilling crews in day-to-day operations, are insufficiently MPD experienced to fully and safely exploit the benefits of the technology. Today, the advanced, and field proven, engineering (mathematical) models that are part and parcel of the software used in well design are also available in state of the art simulators. These engineering models and model based simulators are used by engineers during the design phase of MPD projects to replicate the conditions that will be encountered during actual well construction; picking optimal casing setting depths, using different equipment set-ups, selecting optimal drilling parameters and demonstrating the integrity of the design under a wide scenario of well conditions. Once the well design is finalized, and before drilling operations commence, the same well design is programmed into a real-time drilling simulator. During subsequent simulator exercises,, rig personnel are exposed to the range of scenarios that can unfold during actual operations, taking into account uncertainties and unexpected events. Crews, at the hard end of operations, are able to hone their competence to deal with the unexpected in a team environment under the supervision and guidance of experienced coaches. During actual MPD operations, the same advanced models can be used for automatic simulation and well monitoring purposes; they can also be integrated into the MPD control system to accurately maintain the required well pressures. This paper describes the models used and both the classroom simulator-based engineering training and the real-time rig floor simulator training that will respectively provide operator engineers and contractor well site staff the in-depth understanding of MPD that will enable them to develop their respective skills to safely and cost effectively exploit the many benefits offered by MPD.},

  title = {Nonlinear {{Regression Analysis}} and {{System Stiffness Approach}} for {{Formation Integrity Test Interpretation}}},
  isbn = {978-1-61399-501-3},
  doi = {10.2118/184602-MS},
  abstract = {Abstract After drilling out cement at the start of a new wellbore section, a formation integrity test is routinely performed to verify the integrity of the new formation and the cement at the casing shoe. Test results can have large impacts on the drilling operation, such as motivating remedial cementing operations, changing the drilling fluid mass density or the setting depth of casing strings. Interpretation of the test results are often made difficult for a number of reasons, including significant fluid losses to permeable formations, large friction pressure losses, compression of trapped air and unstable pump operation. This paper presents a new supervisory system providing real-time test analysis and automated result interpretation of pressure integrity tests, leak-off tests and extended leak-off tests. Based on a minimum of preconfigured user input, the system covers all test phases, from pressurization, fracture propagation to shut-in and flowback. Rather than relying on computationally intensive modelling of downhole physics, regression techniques are applied to relate surface pressure to injected fluid volume, shut-in duration and volume or time in flowback. System compliance and fluid leakage rates are determined prior to leak-off using a nonlinear regression model. The calibrated model is in turn used to generate prediction intervals for detecting leak-off and fracture pressures. Extended leak-off interpretation is based on the system stiffness approach, in which fracture closure is associated with a reduction in system compliance. We apply regression techniques to search for fracture closure during shut-in and during flowback. The system identifies unexpected test behavior and triggers warnings by continuously evaluating key test metrics such as leakage rate, system compliance and surface pressure during each test phase. The development is based on few model assumptions. Low-pass filtering combined with regression techniques ensure that the system is capable of analyzing field tests of variable quality and with noisy surface sensor measurements. We assess the performance based on historical tests that are representative of the variation in possible pressure-volume behaviors and with typical noise levels on input sensor signals. The system output corresponds well with the original manual test interpretations, and provides in most cases reliable determination of leak-off and fracture pressures, fracture propagation and fracture closure pressures. Real-time test supervisory functionality in addition to standardization of test interpretation and data storage are immediate benefits of system implementation.},

  abstract = {The history and theory supporting the idea of a universal log law for turbulent wall-bounded flows are briefly reviewed. The original idea of justifying a log law from a constant Reynolds stress layer argument is found to be deficient. By contrast, it is argued that the logarithmic friction law and velocity profiles derived from matching inner and outer profiles for a pipe or channel flow are well-founded and consistent with the data. But for a boundary layer developing along a flat plate it is not, and in fact it is a power law theory that seems logically consistent. Even so, there is evidence for at least an empirical logarithmic fit to the boundary-friction data, which is indistinguishable from the power law solution. The value of kappa approximately 0.38 obtained from a logarithmic curve fit to the boundary-layer velocity data, however, does not appear to be the same as for pipe flow for which 0.43 appears to be the best estimate. Thus, the idea of a universal log law for wall-bounded flows is not supported by either the theory or the data.},

  abstract = {Abstract Due to the recent drop in the oil prices, the oil and gas industry is experiencing tremendous pressures to reduce costs. This is especially true for both Subsea Production Systems (SPS) development and operations to ensure profitability while meeting increasing regulatory requirements. In the last years, the modelling and simulation of multiphase flows has become a powerful engineering tool to conduct virtual experiments during design and development for many industries, such as aerospace, automotive, energy and healthcare. This is mainly due to the significant improvement of the modelling approaches which include more details of multiphase flow physics and phenomena. An additional growth contribution is due to the rapid development of the computational resources and computer power. The oil and gas industry can benefit from high fidelity multiphase flow modelling and simulation tools to minimize the cost of production system design during the project development phase as well as to support optimized operation and assessment of production performance. Because of the low-risk virtual environment, the use of multiphase flow modelling and simulation tools will also reduce the cost of physical testing, assist development of new technologies, and the evaluation of novel concepts. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of multiphase flow simulation tools and their recent evolution and adaptation for subsea applications. The focus is on multiphase flow modelling using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation tools, and in particular on their capabilities and limitations when applied to predict the hydrocarbons behavior throughout their journey from the reservoir to the processing facility. Applications of multiphase CFD tools to support the design, operation and monitoring of SPS and the developments and validations required for replacing costly laboratory tests, component qualification and field tests are also addressed and discussed.},

  abstract = {The hor\textasciitilde{}zontal pipeline flow of coarse-particle slurries has been examined. The
study includes an evaluation of previous work, an experimental investigation and a
presentation of improved modelling techniques for determining pipeline design
parameters.
The experimental investigation was carried out to obtain an improved database
for modelling the flow of coarse-particle slurries. Tests were conducted using sand
slurries and coal slurries in pipes of industrial scale. Frictional headlosses, delivered
solids concentrations, concentration distributions and velocity distributions were
measured as functions of in situ solids concentration and mean velocity. Solids
deposition velocities were determined visually using transparent pipe sections.
The experimental results were used to develop an improved two layer model for
estimating frictional headlosses, a force balance model for concentration distributions
and a method for predicting deposition velocities. The fraction of contact load, which
contributes sliding friction at the pipe wall, was found to be primarily dependent on the
ratio of the mean flow velocity to the settling velocity of the mass median coarse
(+0.074 mm) particle size.
The models contain empirical correlations which incorporate a wide range of
experimental conditions but are restricted to mixtures containing less than 35\%coarse
particles by volume. The correlations were tested using carrier fluids which were
essentially Newtonian with viscosities less than 4 mPa.s.},

  abstract = {An experimental study was performed to understand the relationship between fluid characteristics and its solids transport and
sand suspension capabilities. In this study, borate crosslinked guar gels were prepared at three different pHs. The linear guar was
crosslinked with borate crosslinker at concentrations from zero to the values where the gel exhibited phase separation at each pH.
These gels were then characterized for viscoelastic properties and suspension settling velocities. At each pH, a crosslinker
concentration was selected to evaluate the gels for their solids transport behavior in two large size slot models. The gels that
satisfactorily transported solids through the slots had similar elastic moduli. The results show that the fluid elasticity, not viscosity,
correlates with the solids transport capability of the crosslinked guar gels. Furthermore, the drag coefficients for the suspensions
settling in the crosslinked gels prepared at three pHs were dissimilar, even at similar Weissenberg numbers. The drag on the
suspensions settling in the viscoelastic guar gels was observed to be both more and less than the drag on the suspensions settling in
the Newtonian fluids. Further work is needed to better understand these drag behaviors on the suspensions settling in viscoelastic
guar gels.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the prediction of critical conditions for the behaviour of particles in simulated oil-drilling fluids. In practice, the rheology of many oil-drilling fluids can be represented adequately by a power-law model and the behaviour of spherical particles can give valuable information on the behaviour of less regularly shaped particles. In this paper, the flow of a power-law fluid past a single sphere located on the axis of a cylindrical pipe is simulated numerically. Two different regimes are considered. In the settling regime, the spherical particle moves through a quiescent fluid. For this regime, drag coefficients for a wide range of power-law indices and particle Reynolds numbers are computed. Power-law indices range from n = 0.4 to n = 1 and Reynolds numbers (based upon the radius of the sphere and the settling velocity) are in the range 0.2 ⩽ Rep ⩽ 100 for sphere/cylinder diameter ratios of and . An expression is proposed which determines the drag coefficient in power-law fluids as a function of power-law index n and particle Reynolds number Rep. Numerical results are compared with both experimental results and other published numerical results. In the transport regime, the fluid is in motion relative to the pipe and the sphere, so that the fluid in the cylinder is sheared. Drag coefficients in the mid-Reynolds-number range for the transport regime are compared with those obtained in the settling regime. Finally, the numerical results have been presented in the form of two graphs which can be used to predict velocities of particles settling in power-law fluids and also to predict the maximum-sized particle which can be transported upwards by the flow of a power-law fluid.},

  abstract = {Addition of a small amount of very large polymer molecules or micelle-forming surfactants to a liquid can dramatically reduce the energy dissipation it exhibits in the turbulent flow regime. This rheological drag reduction phenomenon is widely used, for example, in the Alaska pipeline, but it is not well-understood, and no comparable technology exists to reduce turbulent energy consumption in flows of gases, inwhich polymers or surfactants cannot be dissolved. The most striking feature of this phe- nomenon is the existence of a so-called maximum drag reduction (MDR) asymptote: for a given geometry and driving force, there is a maximum level of drag reduction that can be achieved through addition of polymers. Changing the concentration, molecular weight or even the chemical structure of the additives has little to no effect on this asymptotic value. This universality is the major puzzle of drag reduction. We describe direct numerical simulations of turbulent minimal channel flow of Newtonian fluids and viscoelastic polymer solutions. Even in the absence of polymers, we show that there are intervals of “hibernating” turbulence that display very low drag as well as many other features of the MDR asymptote observed in polymer solutions. As Weissenberg number increases to moderate values the frequency of these intervals also increases, and a simple theory captures key features of the intermittent dynamics observed in the simulations. At higher Weissenberg number, these intervals are altered – for example, their duration becomes substantially longer and the instantaneous Reynolds shear stress during them becomes very small. Additionally, simulations of “edge states,” dynamical trajectories that lie on the boundary between turbulent and laminar flow, display characteristics that are similar to those of hibernating turbulence and thus to the MDR asymptote, again even in the absence of polymer additives. Based on these observations, we propose a tentative unified description of rheological drag reduction. The existence of MDR-like intervals even in the absence of additives sheds light on the observed universality of MDR and may ultimately lead to new flow control approaches for improving energy efficiency in a wide range of processes.},

  title = {Transitional Flow Behaviour of High Concentration Mineral Slurry},
  abstract = {To enable accurate pump and piping system design to be undertaken for high concentration mineral slurries, the slurry needs to be characterised and the laminar-turbulent transition confidently predicted so to determine the flow regime the designed system will operate in. Direct application of the yield-pseudoplastic model to the pipeloop test work data enables determination of the rheological parameters used in the slurry characterisation allowing the use of the established laminar-turbulent transition prediction methods. This empirical study compares 9 established laminar-turbulent transition prediction methods, based on the modified Reynolds number approach, against 26 observed laminar-turbulent transition velocities using pipeloop test work results of two high concentration mineral slurries; zinc tailings and fly ash. The best performing laminar-turbulent prediction methods for both slurry types were able to accommodate the three rheological parameters; Yield stress, fluid consistency index and flow behaviour index to capture the complexity of these non-Newtonian slurries. Other future work identified during this study include; determining modified Reynolds number slurries actually transition at to challenge transition criteria of Re ̃ 2100, the influence of yield stress as more than simply an ordinate off-set in predicting transition, and the phenomenon of the spike in standard deviation of the pressure gradient during transition.},

  title = {Model-Based Estimation of Multi-Phase Flows in Horizontal Wells},
  abstract = {The growing demand for hydrocarbon production has resulted into improved oilfield management with various control and optimization strategies. These strategies in turn strongly rely on the efficiency of downhole equipment which is used to obtain real- time oil and gas production rates with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, multiphase flowmeters installed downhole can improve the production of horizontal wells by allocating the zones of oil, gas and water inflow. However, existing multiphase meters are expensive, inaccurate or accurate only within a limited operating range and therefore such monitoring is unrealistic. To overcome these problems one can use so-called multiphase soft-sensors, i.e. to estimate flow rates from conventional meters, such as downhole pressure gauges, in combination with a dynamic multiphase flow model. The soft-sensors can also be used together with hardware sensors to improve their overall performance, e.g. by substituting missing data of the approach combines the accuracy of the conventional Kalman filtering with the robustness of the implicit forward modelling. The proposed algorithm is successfully applied for the solution of the one-dimensional problem of permeability estimation in a porous medium for a single phase oil flow. Finally, a new approach for optimal control and real-time monitoring of horizontal wells is presented. This methodology uses inverse modelling concepts to estimate downhole flow rates that are not measured directly. The analysis of transient pressure response due to a rapid inflow from a reservoir has shown that the available information is not sufficient to estimate simultaneously velocity and composition components, as they act on the different time scales. The real-time estimator proposed uses a dynamic model of the multiphase pipe flow and information from conventional downhole sensors. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been studied for simulation based case studies both for noisy synthetic measurements and artificial data generated by the OLGA simulator. The obtained results indicate that the model based estimator proposed is promising for real-time production optimization purposes. hardware sensor with output of the soft-senor. The research presented in this thesis discusses possibilities and limitations of such multiphase soft-sensors. First a numerical model has been developed and used to predict rapid transients in gas-liquid flows. A drift-flux model which describes one-dimensional gas-liquid flows in a horizontal wellbore is considered in this work. This model consists of a continuity equation for each phase and a momentum equation written for the mixture. The difference between liquid and gas velocities is taken into account using an algebraic slip relation. The numerical solution is obtained using an explicit flux-splitting scheme. A special treatment of the source terms, which characterize an inflow from the reservoir, is required in order to preserve the conservative properties of the scheme. This is achieved extending the schemes developed for non-homogeneous hyperbolic equations, where an integrated source is newly introduced, which retains an exact balance with flux gradients. This new wellbore simulator has been tested on a series of generic test cases, comparing it to data generated by OLGA, a commercially available wellbore simulator. The obtained results show that the new simulator provides accurate predictions of flow variables. An assessment of the time-integration scheme impact on results of data assimilation based on the extended Kalman filter approach is performed. The use of the implicit Euler scheme, which is unconditionally stable for the whole range of time steps both for the model and covariance update, results in a less accurate estimates, which can be overcome using a parameter estimator based on the explicit Euler scheme. However, the latter strongly limits the maximum time step, which can be used, and leads to inappropriate simulation time. An alternative can be found using a semi-implicit estimator, where a model is updated using the implicit Euler scheme, whereas the propagation of the error covariance matrix in time is based on the explicit time integration scheme.

  title = {Particle Transportation in Turbulent Non-{{Newtonian}} Suspensions in Open Channels},
  abstract = {The turbulent behaviour of non-Newtonian suspensions in open channel conditions is investigated
here. There is a lack of fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in the transport of
suspension particles in non-Newtonian fluids, hence direct numerical simulation into the research is
a useful validation tool. A better understanding of the mechanism operating in the turbulent flow of
non-Newtonian suspensions in open channel would lead to improved design of many of the systems
used in the mining and mineral processing industries.
Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the turbulent flow of non-Newtonian fluids in an open
channel has been modelled using a spectral element-Fourier method. The simulation of a yield–
pseudoplastic fluid using the Herschel-Bulkley model agreed qualitatively with experimental results
from field measurements of mineral tailing slurries. The effect of variation of the flow behaviour
index has been investigated and used to assess the sensitivity of the flow to this physical parameter.
This methodology is seen to be useful in designing and optimising the transport of slurries in open
channels.
The aim of this work is to understand the underlying phenomena and mechanisms operating in the
turbulent flow of non-Newtonian suspensions in open channels, in particular their ability to
transport suspended particles. It is intended to achieve the following objectives:
• Demonstrate how the rheological characteristics of the continuous medium carrier
fluid influence the transport of solid particles in the suspension
• Carry out modification of existing computational model to describe the non-
Newtonian open channel flow and validate by experimental measurements
• Establish relationships between rheology of the fluid and turbulent characteristics of
the flow
• Establish relationships between rheology of the fluid and particle suspension in an
open channel flow
There is a substantial amount of literature on turbulent flow in pipe and open channel flow. In this
thesis, both experimental and computational studies for channel flow of non-Newtonian fluids have
been carried out. The prediction of the velocity profile and other parameters such as Reynolds
stresses and velocity fluctuations were compared with measurements of the same obtained in an
open channel. These results addressed the question of size, intensity and frequency of the turbulent
structures.
The existing computational code could not be used for open channel flow. It was therefore modified
by introducing new boundary conditions on free surface. Rheological parameters were also
incorporated in the computational code. Computational simulation was then validated against a
number of different experimental and computational results. Different velocity distributions were
tested to see the validity of the simulation.
Major investigations have been conducted to observe the effect of different rheological parameters
on the simulation results. The major contribution from this study is that the simulation method
provided the opportunity to examine the effect of changing one rheology parameter while keeping
the other parameters constant. The relationship between rheological parameters and flow
characteristics is Reynolds number dependent. It is concluded that the simulation can simulate non-
Newtonian turbulent open channel flow reasonably well. A further investigation on secondary
current was also conducted. It appears that with a smaller Reynolds number, weak and large size
turbulent structures appear in the middle region of the channel.
Furthermore, Stokes number, low velocity streaks intensities and sizes have been studied. It is
determined that the Reynolds number has more effects than rheological parameters on the low
velocity streak size. It is found that the largest percentage of ejection and sweep events occurred
away from the centreline and close to the wall at a height 10-20 cm from the bottom. It is already
known that particles are easier to be suspended and re-suspended in those areas. In addition, it is
also reinforced that the secondary current cell can assist the re-suspension of particles.
This study of non-Newtonian suspension flow in open channel will provide fundamental
information for understanding the behaviour of fluid structure and the relationship between fluid
and particles. This information will also be applicable to the design and operation of industrial channels for the transport of mineral suspensions leading to improved channel management and
economic outcomes.},

The objectives of this project is to study the rheology of invert emulsion drilling fluid or invert oil drilling fluid, which is a type of oil-based drilling fluid (OBM) using different concentrations of the rheology modifier, VisPlus. The rheology of drilling fluid with different concentrations of VisPlus were analyzed and compared against rheological requirements.

  abstract = {AbstractFrictional pressure loss calculations in narrow annuli of slim-hole and coiled tubing operations require more accuracy than before. The paper describes a method to calculate pressure losses that better represents actual annular configurations.The skewed (vertical wells, varying eccentricity) and uniformly eccentric (deviated wells) geometries are addressed. Easy to use realistic correlations are obtained for laminar, transition and turbulent flow regimes. Experimental flow loop data validate model predictions. A step-by-step procedure is included for field calculations.IntroductionSlimhole drilling and coiled tubing operations involve fluid flow in narrow annular geometries. As field experience and theoretical calculations have shown, decreasing annular clearance completely modifies the distribution of pressure losses in a well : contrary to conventional drilling, the major part of pump pressure-more than 80\% when inner to outer diameter ratio exceeds 0.8-is lost to friction in the annulus. As the resulting equivalent circulating densities (ECD) are much higher than those in conventional wells, formation can be exposed to excessive pressures. Wellbore stability becomes, therefore, an important issue when defining parameters governing annular flow.The current practices for efficient hole cleaning consist of increasing flow rate and/or fluid rheology, which in both cases give higher ECD. In conventional drilling the increase in ECD by annular pressure losses is usually small compared to the hydrostatic pressure gradient. So, wellbore stability and efficient hole cleaning can be guaranteed by independent choices on mud density on the one hand and flow properties on the other,In narrow annular spaces, however, high annular pressure losses may result in ECD values close to or higher than formation fracture gradient. Accurate modeling of annular pressure losses is therefore needed in order to successfully adjust fluid density and rheology to the whole set of drilling parameters.Annular pressure losses depend on fluid rheology, flow regime and the geometry of the annulus, Previous models treat either concentric or eccentric annuli and assume uniformity along the wellbore.Concentric annular flow has received considerable attention, At laminar flow conditions exact models are available for Newtonian, power law and Bingham plastic fluids, Recently, Reed and Pilehvari proposed a model for laminar, transitional and turbulent flows. This model extends well established results on Newtonian and non-Newtonian pipe flow-in particular Dodge and Metzner's work to concentric annular flow.Models also exist for uniformly eccentric annuli in laminar flow, analytical for Newtonian and numerical for non-Newtonian fluids.P. 113\^},

  abstract = {We present our strategy and implementation of a data centric
framework with focus on information 
interchange for multi-scale fluid mechanics simulations. We
propose a schema for defining meta-data for possible 
standardization for the Multiscale Cluster/ICMEg consortium. Within the NanoSim consortium, WP1 deals with 
defining a framework (Porto) for connecting and utilizing software simulators of different scales through offline-coupling. The focus of engineering applications within the NanoSim project is fluidized beds. For such large-scale 
applications the most promising multi-scale simulation strategy is to focus on representative elements of the 
simulation domain, resolving these representative elements on a small scale, and feed the result into a sub-grid 
model on the next larger scale. Within NanoSim, the following 6 scales are accounted for:
1. System scale, simulated by a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs),
2. Equipment scale, simulated by Large Scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulations,
3. Cluster scale, simulated by coupled CFD DEM (Discrete Element) simulations,
4. Particle scale, simulated by CFD-DEM simulations and CFD/DNS (Direct Numerical) Simulations,
5. Intra-particle pore scale, simulated by Intra-Particle simulation coupled to CFD-DEM and
6. Atomistic scale, simulated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Kinetic Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations.

Porto serves to connect the different simulators, which is a nonhomogenous set of in-house, open source and proprietary simulators, running on different operating systems. The complexity and diversity of such a system 
requires that we have formal schemas and structures of meta-data that allows for information interpretation 
regardless of the original storage format and application. Porto offers the possibility to utilize MongoDB for meta-data and data storage, with features such as load balancing, data replication over multiple machines, map-reduce 
aggregation and complex searches},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the hydrodynamic behavior of gas–solid two-phase flowin the annular space of an air drilling well under different arrangements by using three-dimensional approach. Two-fluid model is used to solve the governing equations in the Eulerian–Eulerian framework. Effect of eccentricity and drill pipe rotation on the pressure drop, volume fraction and velocity profile are examined. The results are compared with available data in the literature and good agreement is found. The results show that the presence of solid particles in the annulus change the air velocity profile significantly and create two off-center peaks velocity close to the walls instead of one peak velocity in the middle. Eccentricity of drill pipe makes more accumulation of the cuttings in the smaller space of the annulus. Increasing the eccentricity increases pressure drop due to impact of particles with annulus wall and also particles collision with each other. Rotation of the drill pipe shifts maximum air velocity location toward smaller space of the annulus which results more uniform cutting distributions in the annulus and improvement in their transportations. Pressure drop in the annulus increases as eccentricity and rotation of drill pipe increase.},

  abstract = {The flow of non-Newtonian fluids in rectangular open channels has received renewed interest over the past number of years especially as large flumes are being used to transport tailings in countries like Chile. The effect of yield stress on the flow behavior is complex and not yet fully understood. The Ultrasonic Velocity Profiling (UVP) technique has been used to construct velocity profiles of non-Newtonian fluids flowing in a 10 m by 300 mm wide tilting flume. The contour maps were integrated to show that the velocity profiles were indeed correct. The thin film flow models available in the literature have been tested in terms of flow depth and Reynolds number. The measured profiles also show the influence of the side walls on the general flow features as the distance from the centre increases. The results reported herein span the laminar, transition and turbulent flow regions. As far as can be ascertained, it is the first time that this technique has been used to measure velocity profiles in opaque non-Newtonian fluids for open channel flow. It is shown here that, under appropriate conditions, the velocity profile and flow depth can be used to obtain the viscous properties of the fluids tested. Excellent correspondence between the rheological parameters inferred from the velocity profile measurements and that from the tube viscometry was obtained.},

  abstract = {When predicting pressure gradients for the flow of sludges in pipes, the rheology of the fluid plays an important role, especially with increasing concentration of the suspended matter in the sludge. The f-Re relationship is often applied when designing pipelines, but it depends on the rheological parameters of the fluid and what definition of non-Newtonian Reynolds number is used. In this work, a database of 586 \&\#196;P \&\#8211; Q points from tests with 10 different sludges of concentration 3.4 to 7.2\% by mass, in 3 test pipe diameters, was established and used to rheologically characterise the sludges as Bingham plastic fluids. Five published definitions of the non-Newtonian Reynolds number were used to create composite power law correlations for the f-Re relationship covering all flow regimes. Pressure gradient predictions based on each correlation were compared and ranked, based on 2 different statistical estimates of error. The correlations using the Metzner-Reed Reynolds number (ReMR) and a Reynolds number proposed by Slatter and Lazarus in 1993 (Re2) yielded the lowest errors in comparison with the experimental values. It is shown that these correlations can be used to predict pressure drop to within \&\#177;20\% for a given sludge concentration and operating condition.},

  abstract = {This project was performed on behalf of SINTEF Materials and Chemistry in close collaboration
with Lyng Drilling, part of the Schlumberger Group. The scope of the project has been to
develop a method for geometry and setup simplifications on a Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) simulation made on a drill bit at work; to see if there is a possibility to implement this
type of simulations as a step in the product development process of drill bits at the company Lyng
Drilling. This in order to establish the local flow-patterns around the drill bit, that governs among
other things how the cuttings is transported away and the cooling of the drill bit. The drill bits
often have a pattern of surface erosion, caused by an increased intensity and velocity of the flow
at that area. Zones with low flow velocity, stagnation points, can cause problems to the drilling
as cuttings and mud can get stuck there subsequently leading to clogging of the drill head and
increased energy required for the overall drilling. The only success on simulating the mud flow
around the drill bit was obtained with transient simulations on a stationary drill bit. A rotating
case was simulated with dynamic mesh, but simulation time was estimated to exceed 6 months,
and this scenario was one of the limitations set initially in the project.
No industrial gain can be obtained by implementing CFD-simulations as a step in the product development
process for the design of drill bits at Lyng Drilling. The simulations are far too complex
and require a lot of work and simulation time, as well as the parameter assumptions are too many.},

Annular fluid velocities in our study varied from 0.4 m/s to 1.2 m/s. The effect of annulus inclination and drill pipe rotation on the carrying capacity of drilling fluid, particle rising velocity, and pressure drop in a slim hole annulus were measured for fully developed flows of water, and for aqueous solutions of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and bentonite. For higher particle feed concentrations, the hydraulic pressure drop of the mixture flow increased due to friction between the wall and solids, or among solids.

Similar agreement is found for the authors' own data for flow of 10 slurries between parallel plates. The Bingham plastic model is shown to be a reliable representation of the flow of non-Newtonian slurries provided it is properly applied. If the Hedstrom number He= pD ro/n greater than 10, then the linear approximation method of Caldwell and Babbitt is invalid for pipe flow data obtained in systems of ordinary engineering interest, and the complete nonlinear form of the pipe flow Bingham plastic equation must be used in determining rheological parameters.},

The expression for the velocity leads to a friction factor - Reynolds number relation which also has a fluidity number as a parameter. Methods are considered for the solution of problems which obviate the need for iteration. The corresponding treatment for the usual viscous representation is given in the Appendix..},

Perhaps the most widely accepted and quoted of these formulae is that due to Dodge and Metzner (2) which is also stated to be rigorous. Some consideration is given to the Dodge-Metzner equation which seems to show that far from being rigorous it is not valid for real fluids. Moreover the formula of Bowen (1), which is the exceptional case not requiring laminar flow data, gives superior correlations and is, therefore, to be preferred. Using a diameter independence hypothesis and Bowen's formula it is possible to find an expression for the turbulent velocity profile. This is checked indirectly by comparing the theoretical and experi- mental friction factors. In a number of cases (but not all) the comparison is favourable.},

Here we report observation of a new regime where irregular motion is observed. We argue that this irregular motion may be interpreted as onset of chaos. Observation of this regime depends on the size of the falling sphere, relaxation time of fluid and concentration of particles in the suspension.

  doi = {10.12691/ajna-2-1-4},
  abstract = {Under certain drilling conditions, the weighting material particles such as barite can settle out of the drilling fluid. This phenomenon, known as barite sag, can lead to a number of drilling problems including lost circulation, well control difficulties, poor cement job, and stuck pipe. This study investigates barite sag, both experimentally and numerically, in the annulus under flow conditions. Experimental work has been conducted on a large flow loop to investigate the effects of major drilling parameters on barite sag by measuring the circulating fluid density. Results of the tests indicate that the highest sag occurs at low annular velocities and rotational speed and also at high inclination angles. It was observed that at inclination angles less than 60°, for any annular velocity, barite sag is not significant. Eccentricity of a non-rotating inner pipe did not have a significant effect on barite sag. However, effects of inner pipe rotation on barite sag for an eccentric annulus are more significant than concentric case. The simulation part of this study is based on a proposed particle tracking method called “Particle Elimination Technique”. The traveling path of each solid particle is assumed to be a function of size and shape of the particle, fluid velocity and rheology. Based on the estimated traveling path of particles, density of the fluid is updated considering the number of particles whose paths lead to the bottom of the annulus and become motionless. In order to capture the complexities associated with the solid-liquid flow, a lift force is assigned to the solid particles that enable adjustment of the model with experimental results. Comparing the results of numerical simulation to the experimental study on the effects of annular velocity on barite sag in a horizontal annulus shows a good agreement. The numerical simulation was modified from laboratory scale to real wellbore dimensions for practical drilling applications. Results of the simulation show prediction of the density of the drilling fluid in the horizontal section of a wellbore with various lengths and dimensions under different annular velocities.},

drilling, the circulated drilling fluid must be capable of cleaning the face of the drill bit
and transport the drilled cuttings effectively to the surface without cuttings bed fonnation
to ensure adequate wellbore cleaning performance. For effective cuttings transport and
hole cleaning to be achieved, it is significant for the fluid to be injected at very high flow
rates which may result in wall erosion. However, depending on the operational drilling
conditions, very-high fluid velocities are needed to minimize the drag and frictional
forces. Notwithstanding, the vibration and torque on the wellbore fluid (mixture of
cuttings and air) due to drill pipe rotation is very significant. In this study, wellbore
hydraulics (i.e. annular pressure drop) due to drill pipe rotation was investigated in air
drilling operation. A model was developed, solved using MATLAB and validated by
comparing developed and Adewunmi and Supon (1989) model predictions. The result
showed that the annular pressure drop due to rotation was 4.2\% lower than that of drilling
operation without drill pipe rotation. Also, sensitivity analysis of the drilling operating
system was carried out using Rate of Penetration, Cutting size, Hole size and Injected air
flow rate.},

For the power law model, correlations for the velocity distribution and the time required to reach the steady periodic flow are developed and discussed. Furthermore, the effects of the dimen- sionless parameters on the flow are studied. For the temperature distribution, an analytical solution for Newtonian fluid is developed as a comparative source. To simulate the rheolo- gical behavior of blood at unsteady state, three non-Newtonian constitutive relationships are used to study the wall shear stress. It is found that in the case of unsteady stokes flow, although the patterns of velocity and wall shear stress is consistent across all models, the magnitude is affected by the model utilized.},

product supplied to enable developers to access and produce data recorded in that format.
The standard format, or paper convention, part of CGNS consists of two fundamental pieces. The
first, known as the Standard Interface Data Structures, is described in this Recommended

  abstract = {abstract Increasing cuttings bed height is a serious concern during extended-reach well drilling. In order to predict and prevent cuttings bed height increase, it is essential to study how the critical parameters influence the cuttings transport, especially the drill pipe rotation effects on the cuttings transport process. In conventional models for cuttings transport, the dynamic behavior of particles due to drill pipe rotation is neglected or empirically simplified. This paper presents a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD–DEM) approach to simulate the cuttings transport considering the dynamic collision process. The fluid phase is treated as an Eulerian continuum and described by CFD method. The cutting phase is modeled by DEM using a soft sphere approach for the particle collision dynamic. The continuum and dispersed phases are strongly coupled via the interaction forces such as the drag force, lift force and pressure gradient force, which is taken into account in the developed CFD–DEM model. The model takes into account the collisions of cutting–cutting, cutting–drill pipe and cutting–wall. Simulations are carried out for a number of laboratory-scale configurations, showing good agreement with experiment data reported in literature. The numerical simulations show that the drill pipe rotation builds cuttings presented in non-symmetric distribution along the hole and significantly decreases the cutting volume concentration at the medium and high fluid inlet velocities and lower range of drill pipe speeds. There is no additional contribution of drill pipe rotation after reaching a critical speed at high fluid inlet velocities. At low fluid inlet velocities, increasing the drill pipe rotation from 0 to 80 rpm dose not significantly affect the cuttings concentration; although an increase in drill pipe rotation speed from 100 to 120 rpm provided a remarkable improvement. Furthermore, at low inlet fluid velocities and horizontal inclinations up to 401, drill pipe rotation can significantly decrease the cuttings concentration. The effect of drill pipe rotation on decreasing the cuttings concentration is almost negligible at high inlet fluid velocities for any inclination.},

  abstract = {Problem statement: Oil well cleaning is the ability of a drilling fluid to suspend and
transport drilled cuttings from the down hole (bit face) to the surface. The cleaning performance was
affected by many factors such as fluid viscosity, annular flow velocity, angle of inclination and drill
cuttings size and shape and. Approach: Navier-Stoke equations, the continuity equation and the power
law of non-Newtonian viscosity model were adopted to establish the mathematical model of the cutting
transport process in the annulus of the well. The constants of the power law model were evaluated
experimentally for three different mud types. The CFD simulation to solve the governing equations
was carried out by using FLUENT commercial code. The specifications of the particles, the pumping
head and feeding conditions were obtained from a drilling site in Sudan. Results: Simulation of the
mud flow in the annulus had shown that in spite of the laminar nature of the flow, the velocity profile
was flattening over wide area of the annulus. Such condition was referred to as fog flow and was
preferable to produce uniform drag distribution to lift the particles without rotation during the
transportation process. The analysis had been conducted for various mud charging rates ranging from
600-900 GPM, in 30° diverted orientation well. The investigation of cuttings size was conducted for
2.54, 4.45 and 7 mm. Also, the effect of the cuttings shape with 1, 0.9 and 0.85 was investigated and it
was found that higher sphereicity have better cleaning efficiency. Conclusion: The analyses revealed
that for 30° diverted orientation; the effective cleaning performance was achieved when the drilling
mud charging was higher than 800 GPM for all types of tested cuttings. The simulation results
revealed that there was a significant effect of the cuttings size on the cuttings transport. Fine particles
are the easiest to clean out.},

  abstract = {Effective cuttings removal from the wellbore is one of the major challenges in high inclination and horizontal well drilling applications. High circulation rates required in horizontal and extended reach wells to clean the wellbore from cuttings may not be always feasible due to the risk of increasing dynamic bottom hole pressure reaching the fracture limit of the rock. Achieving good hole cleaning while keeping the dynamic bottom hole pressure within the safe operational window is very often the major engineering challenge. A drag reducing fluid with good hole cleaning ability could be a potential solution in this case. Frictional drag reducing polymers are often composed of high molecular weight linear molecules and can be used with water or hydrocarbon based solvents. The main objective of this experimental study is to compare the cuttings transport performances of water and a drag reducing fluid (PHPA polymer based drilling fluid).},

  abstract = {Efficient transportation of cuttings is a vital factor for a good drilling program. Cutting transport in annulus is a complex problem that is affected by numerous parameters. Predicting effective cuttings transport requires all of these parameters to be considered simultaneously. To better understand the effects of some of the parameters affecting the cutting transportation, a combination of casing-drill pipe annulus section was simulated and a model called ‘discrete phase model’ was used to observe the transportation of cuttings in the annulus. Tests were conducted to determine the effects of mud weight, particle size, drilling rate and viscosity on cutting transportation in both vertical and horizontal section of a well bore. The data collected were graphically correlated in the form of annular velocity with cutting transportation, which was used as a measure of the transportation efficiency. The results indicate that for the same drilling fluid horizontal well has better hole cleaning than vertical well. The results also indicate that the effectiveness of a circulating fluid in removing drilled cuttings is not only dependent on the rheology of the fluid but also on whether the fluid is in laminar or turbulent flow. For the tested particle size ranges (0.10 to 0.275 in.), the cleaning efficiency is partly dependent upon the particle’s size.},

Based on an Euler–Lagrange approach relying on the large-eddy simulation technique for the fluid flow and a particle tracking scheme accounting for all relevant elementary processes (particle rotation, transverse lift forces, inter-particle collisions, particle–wall collisions with smooth and rough walls, coupling between phases) several cases are analyzed in detail to elucidate the origin of secondary flow structures in the pipe cross-section. A smooth glass pipe and a rough steel pipe are taken into account at two different mass loadings considering a polydisperse size distribution with a number mean diameter of about 40 lm mimicking the corresponding reference experiment. After a detailed validation of the single-phase as well as the two-phase flow based on experimental and DNS data, the secondary flow structures are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. That confirms recently published experimental results that the secondary flow observed is of second kind. Finally, to prove that for another particle size distribution numerically investigated in the literature the secondary flow is still of second kind, rather large monodisperse inertial particles (134 lm) hitting the pipe walls with two different roughnesses are additionally simulated. The strength of the secondary flow is found to be strongly reduced for these cases compared with the polydisperse smaller particles, but the mechanism responsible for the secondary flow is the same.},

  abstract = {Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of "intelligent" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and "intelligent" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of "plug-and-play" PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.},

  title = {The {{Effect}} of {{Equivalent Diameter Definitions}} on {{Frictional Pressure Loss Estimation}} in an {{Annulus}} with {{Pipe Rotation}}},
  isbn = {978-1-61399-208-1},
  doi = {10.2118/151176-MS},
  abstract = {Abstract Annular flow of non-Newtonian fluids remains a ubiquitous phenomenon in drilling operations but accurately estimating the frictional pressure loss with drill pipe rotation still poses a great challenge. Since annular frictional pressure losses increases the equivalent circulating density (ECD), it becomes imperative to accurately estimate the annular pressure loss in order to keep the ECD above the pore pressure and below the fracture gradient especially in deep offshore drilling where the pore pressure and fracture pressure are so close together. When annular flows are encountered, a common practice is to calculate an effective diameter such that the flow behavior in a circular pipe would be roughly equivalent to the flow behavior in the annulus. This equivalent diameter definition replaces the diameter term in the friction factor, effective Reynolds number and Taylors number equations used for pipe flow thus resulting in different frictional pressure loss estimation. As a result, the selection of appropriate correlation for the respective fluids, flow regimes and putting into consideration pipe rotation has become important but has received very little attention. In this study, the seven different equivalent diameter definitions used for estimating frictional pressure losses in an annulus were reviewed and theoretical analysis were performed on experimental data obtained from literatures to determine the effect of these definitions on wellbore hydraulics. Pressure loss ratios (PLR) which relates pressure loss with pipe rotation to pressure loss without pipe rotation weredevelopedfor each equivalent diameter definitionusing dimensional analysis techniques. These hydraulic models combined with conventional frictional pressure loss estimation were tested with experimental measurements to determine the model with an equivalent diameter definition that best predicts frictional pressure losses for power law fluids. Introduction One of the major considerations in the development of hydraulic programs for drilling and work-over operations is properly estimating the annular pressure losses of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Since the objective of any drilling operation is to minimize drilling cost and maximize return on investment, optimizing annular friction pressure loss estimation allows making an appropriate evaluation of the well-bore hydraulics necessary for drilling in order to avoid serious problems which can cause interruption in the drilling operations thus resulting to high costs of operation, increase in non-productive time and sometimes lead to well abandonment. Hence, it is very critical to determine annular pressure losses with high accuracy. Pressure loss estimation in annulus is more difficult to model compared to pipe flow since the geometry of the area open to flow is more complex and as a result, different effective diameter definitions have been proposed in the literatures for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. However, for simplicity and convenience, two equations are generally used. The first equation is based upon the definition of the hydraulic diameter, dH, is defined as four times the channel cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter of the flow channel. For an annulus of inner diameter di and outer diameter do, d\_H=d\_o-d\_i. For turbulent flow in ducts running full, the hydraulic diameter, dH, should be substituted for D in the friction factor and Reynolds number definitions. Turbulent flow in noncircular channels is generally accompanied by secondary flows perpendicular to the axial flow direction. These flows may cause the pressure drop to be slightly greater than that computed using the hydraulic diameter method. The hydraulic diameter method does not work well for laminar flow because the shape affects the flow resistance in a way that cannot be expressed as a function only of the ratio of cross-sectional area to wetted perimeter (Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook).},

Specifications on rheometers are not as straight forward as in many other analytical instruments as there are so many factors influencing the measurement.
 
Still we specify +-1\% accuracy on the flowcurve if you are in range. That means above 10 µNm in torque. The instruments are typically much better than that.
 
Attached you find information about the minimum the MCR xx2 series can achieve with live results to prove it. As you can see the MCR is far better than the spec in the brochure.
 
Most other rheometer suppliers are the opposite, writing specs in the brochure that only can be reached in ideal conditions (at best).
 
The Anton Paar specs in the brochure can be reached by anyone, in a normal lab, on normal samples.
 
Hope this can be of help},

  url = {http://d-nb.info/1101965851/34},
  abstract = {Wellbore drilling has experienced an increase in complexity due to the interest in reaching
targets situated in High Pressure-High Temperature (HPHT) environments or constructing
large sections of the well with high deviations from verticality. Established models
for selecting operational flow rates or drilling fluid rheology and density are based on
empirical correlations. These are only applicable for well defined ranges of conditions and
for stationary assumptions not given in complex wellbores. In the last two decades, more
flexible and transient models founded on causal mechanisms responsible of the system’s
behavior are finding wider application. These rely on an accurate understanding of the
phenomena taking place within the wellbore. High resolution numerical models can be
used to increase this understanding. However, experimental data are still needed for their
validation. This thesis provides such experimental data and evaluates high resolution
numerical models able to predict cuttings transport relevant phenomena at the wellbore
diameter scale.
In the experimental part of this thesis, a solid-liquid vertical flow-loop designed and constructed
to generate experimental data for validation is presented. The setup consists of a
64 mm diameter and 2,000 mm length pipe, medicinal white oil and glass spherical particles
with diameters ranging from 2 to 6 mm providing a system with physical phenomena
similar to the one found in cuttings transport. The particle image velocimetry (PIV)
and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) techniques are implemented to obtain liquid and
particles velocity profiles as well as particle position histograms of solid-liquid mono- and
bidisperse flows. This is accomplished through refractive index matching of the dispersed
phase, the continuous phase and the conduct material. Results point out the relevancy of
the lift force in configuring particles distribution across the pipe section. This force creates
concentration accumulations at specific radial positions. Furthermore, a significant
momentum transfer between the considered particles is observed in bidisperse systems.
The computational part of the thesis considers the implementation of the two-fluid method
and the discrete particle model (DPM) to simulate the experimental system and prove
their validity for the prediction of cuttings transport relevant problems. The two-fluid
method shows good agreement with experiments performed with monodisperse systems
and supplies an explanation for the concentration accumulations observed in the experiments.
However, this lacks predictive capacity when polydisperse systems are investigated.
On the other hand, the DPM model implemented here is able to reproduce bidisperse experimental
results up to 3\% concentrations. For higher ones, advanced models considering
particle collisions in viscous fluids should be included. The DPM model is selected as the best alternative for cuttings transport problems. A sensitivity analysis focused on the
effect of eccentricity on vertical particle transport is finally conducted to demonstrate
which information can be extracted. The sensitivity analysis reveals the effect of the lift
force on particle transport, which results in better transport than the one predicted with
the homogeneous particle distribution assumption, normally taken in drilling engineering
calculations.},

Today,HDDis becoming widely accepted as a cost-effective alternative to traditional open-cut construction. The occurrence of hydraulic fracturing, resulting in the migration of drilling fluid to the surface, has placed the HDD process under scrutiny, especially when con- sidered for projects in environmentally sensitive areas. Hydraulic fracturing results when fluidic pressure within the borehole exceeds the shear strength or undrained cohesion of the strata. Models have been developed to predict borehole pressures; however, there is only limited information available on the properties of drilling returns obtained during HDD installations. A research program was under- taken to determine flow characteristics for drilling returns under a variety of soil conditions and bore penetration rates. Soil samples were gathered based on the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and their rheological properties were obtained for different drilling flu- ids and slurry densities. Presented in this paper is a methodology for predicting borehole fluid pressures over a wide range of project parameters that can be used as a guide to minimize the occurrence of hydraulic fracturing. ?},

  abstract = {There is an increasing requirement for centralized analysis of drilling data to improve performance. Typically, data from service companies is transmitted from the rig to the clients Real Time Operating Centre (RTOC).  A major problem is the quality of this data, which can lead to incorrect analysis and a breakdown in trust between the rig and the RTOC. Currently real time data is, at best, only checked for completeness.

In this work, we present a model for data quality control in real-time operating centres. The following points are considered in our suggested model:

1. Monitoring the quality of real time data for: Completeness, Continuity, Timeliness, Validity, Accuracy, Consistency, Integrity.
2. Alarming of all unexpected data;
3. Generating daily data quality reports.

 

The suggested data quality control model has different groups of key performance indicators, calculated in real time from the streamed data. The model then takes the values of these performance indicators as input, and evaluates different properties of data quality as the output. Additionally, a new group of intelligent model-based key performance indicators is suggested. These indicators give the possibility to monitor actual quality and measure it against the expected one. The result is a measurement of Quality of Service (QoS) supplied by data provider at the rig.},

  abstract = {A number of correlations for friction factor determinations in smooth pipes have been proposed in the past decades. The accuracy and applicability of these friction factor formulas should be examined. Based on this notion the paper is designed to provide a comparative study of friction factor correlations in smooth pipes for all flow regimes of Bingham fluids. Nine models were chosen. The comparisons of the selected equations with the existing experimental results, which are available in the literature, were expressed through MARE, MRE+, MRE-, RMSE, Ѳ, and S. The statistical comparisons were also carried out using MSC and AIC. The analyses show that the Wilson-Thomas (1985) and Morrison (2013) models are best fit models to the experimental data for the Reynolds number up to 40000. Within this range, both models can be used alternately. But beyond this Re value the discrepancy of the Wilson-Thomas model is higher than the Morrison model. In view of the fact that the Morrison model requires fewer calculations and parameters as well as a single equation is used to compute the friction factor for all flow regimes, it is the authors’ advice to use this model for friction factor estimation for the flow of Bingham fluids in smooth pipes as an alternative to the Moody chart and other implicit formulae.},

In earlier work it was shown that functional gains for the feedback control law served well as a dataset for reduced order basis generation via the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). However, the test problem was the two-dimensional heat equation, a problem in which the physics dominates the system in such a way that controller efficacy is difficult to generalize. Here, we additionally incorporate a nonlinear observer by including the nonlinear terms of the state equation in the differential equation for the compensator.},

This is motivated by the desire to avoid spurious unphysical values that could crash a large simulation.

The model is based on general, non-orthogonal, boundary-fitted, curvilinear coordinates, and represents a new approach to the solution of annular flow problems. The use of an effective viscosity in the governing equation of the flow allows the study of the flow behavior of any type of fluid. The model has been developed primarily to simulate the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids in eccentric annuli during drilling and completion operations. Predicted flow rates versus pressure gradient for laminar flow of Newtonian fluids in concentric and eccentric annuli, and Power-law fluids in concentric annuli compare very well with results derived from analytical expressions. Moreover, the predictions for laminar flow of Power-law and Yield-Power law fluids in eccentric annuli are in excellent agreement with numerical and experimental data published in the literature. The model was also successfully applied to the case of laminar flow of Power-law fluids in an eccentric annulus containing a stationary bed of cuttings and the results are presented herein},

The approach presented is independent of the form of the rheological model of choice, makes no assumptions about conduit geometry, can include the presence of a laminar plug flow region, accommodate drillpipe rotation effects and account for the effects of annular eccentricity. Simple, explicit and general formulations for approximating pressure losses over Measurement While Drilling tools (MWD's) and Positive Displacement Motors (PDM's) are also presented to augment the suite of expressions required for comprehensive hydraulic calculation over the circulating system. Furthermore, procedures for establishing realistic bounds of confidence for laminar pressure loss functions are presented - enabling computation of the degree of certainty attributable to such a calculation. This procedure is applicable to any function requiring fitted parameters, hence it has a broader application potential than just drilling hydraulics. The model demonstrates good agreement with measured data from studies involving real drilling fluids flowing in both circular and annular conduits.IntroductionThe efficiency and effectiveness of drilling slimhole, horizontal and underbalanced wells is markedly improved when reasonable certainty can be ascribed to all parts of the circulating system. Accurate quantification of system losses enhances the validity of calculated equivalent circulating density - ECD, and other drilling parameters and indicators. Advantages of more precise ECD estimates include: proper maintenance of the integrity of underbalanced conditions; prevents lost circulation; indicates the likelihood of a potential kick and improves overall drilling efficiency through improved hole cleaning. Unfortunately, the typically high annular pressure drops associated with slimhole (high aspect ratio, Di/Do) drilling operations cannot be accurately predicted through conventional laminar and turbulent flow functions (with such losses b ing as much as 80\% of total system parasitic loss). This is due to the use of the slot-flow assumption used to allow formulation of tractable annular flow functions. Errors attributable solely to this approximation increase significantly as the aspect ratio increases.Certain non-Newtonian turbulent flow friction factor correlations are also unsuited for specific applications due to the particular fluid types, and conduit geometry, upon which they were constructed. Consequently, confidence based on quantities calculated using conventional pressure loss functions may be low, with potentially detrimental implications for primary and incidental calculated quantities.This paper attempts to resolve some of these issues by presenting a number of new formulations suitable for application to hydraulic calculations for slimhole, underbalanced and horizontal wells. The role of the reological model is discussed first to establish their proper application within the context of the proposed model. In the section headed 'New Rheological Parameter' the in situ (or 'generalised') flow behaviour index is introduced with appropriate solution procedures. This is followed by a definition of a GRN under the section 'Generalised Reynolds Number.' P. 279\^},

  abstract = {AbstractOut Of Straightness (OOS) survey is an investigation procedure aimed to acquire information about the vertical and horizontal configuration of offshore pipelines. The main objective of OSS survey is to provide:• Detailed design and during construction: a quantitative basis for assessment of global - eulerian buckling (upheaval and lateral buckling as results of axial loads due to restrained thermal expansion) in presence of out-of-straightness. This is the case of buried pipelines for which the straightness of the bottom of the trench is a factor.• During operation: verification of the presence of expected or unexpected buckles where bending may exceed the operational limits established for the material and pipe wall thickness, by the mechanical design. This is mainly the case of exposed pipelines for which unexpected lateral deflection can be the result of incidental third party interaction.Global buckling is a significant design topic for HP/HT flowlines or export pipelines in the early stretch, where thermal expansion might be recovered by developing excessive bending. Therefore, the development of specific techniques to perform OOS survey as well as the analysis of the acquired data is getting increasingly crucial, since the outcome of this activity drives the decisions on mitigations needed for pipeline safe operation as per design. After a brief description of the OOS survey technology and engineering interpretative tools, a few operational applications are presented. External survey and in-line inspection outcomes are compared in correspondence of pipeline sections affected by global buckling. The effectiveness of the available technology and engineering tools is discussed.},

The absence of standard procedures and specifications for PAC and XG materials have created confusing interpretations of the quality and expected performance. This opened the way to adulteration, primarily with starches (in PAC) and guar gum (in XG). A survey made within the API organization identified the need of standard performance testing procedures and specifications for pure-grade PAC and XG materials as well as adopting a test to easily identify the presence of adulterants. Simple procedures have been developed to identify starch or guar gum presence and establish performance testing procedures. Numerous round-robin tests have been performed to fine-tune the testing procedures and measure intra and inter-labs reproducibility. Only testing procedures providing results with an acceptable standard deviation have been approved. A new set of specifications including the following were finally defined: -~~~~~~ moisture content, fluid loss and viscosity (for PAC) -~~~~~~ moisture content, particle size analysis and viscosity (for XG) The final procedures and specifications for both PAC and XG will be published with the new revision of the API 13 A/ISO 13500 in January 2009.},

phenomena, either in the linear region where the microstructure responds linearly with respect to the stress and strain

found time-response of a microstructure that is itself changing with time makes thixotropic, viscoelastic behaviour one
of the greatest challenges facing rheologists today, in terms of its accurate experimental characterisation and its
adequate theoretical description. Here a history of thixotropy is given, together with a description of how it is
understood today in various parts of the scientific community. Then a mechanistic description of thixotropy is
presented, together with a series of applications where thixotropy is important. A list of different examples of
thixotropic systems is then given. Finally the various kinds of theories that have been put forward to describe the

The Kaolin slurry consists of very fine solid particles, so the solid particles concentration, and density, and viscosity are assumed to be constant across the pipe.

The problem of closurewas solved by the Launder and Sharma k-epsilon turbulence model (Launder and Sharma, Lett Heat Mass Transf 1:131–138, 1974) but with a different turbulence damping function. The turbulence damping function, used in the mathematical model in the present paper, is that proposed by Bartosik (1997). The mathematical model uses the apparent viscosity concept and the ap- parent viscosity was calculated using two- and three-parameter rheological models, namely Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley. The main aim of the paper is to compare measurements and predictions of the frictional head loss and velocity distribution, taking into account two- and three-parameter rheological models, namely Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley, if the Kaolin slurry possesses low, moderate, and high yield stress. Predictions compared with measurements show an observable advantage of the Herschel–Bulkley rheological model over the Bingham model particularly if the bulk velocity decreases.},

examines the influence of particle diameter on additional shear stress due to the
‘particles-wall’ interactions for moderate and high solid concentration. The mathematical
model was developed using Bagnold’s concept, [26] and assumes that the
total wall shear stresses are equal to the sum of ‘liquid-wall’ and ‘particles-wall’ shear
stresses. The mathematical model was successfully verified with own measurements
of frictional head loss in vertical coarse – dispersive slurry flow, named: ‘sand-water’,
‘polystyrene-water’ and ‘pvc-water’, [10], [26]. The mathematical model can predict
‘particles-wall’ shear stress, pressure drop and friction factor for coarse-dispersive
turbulent slurry flow in a pipe, [10].
The aim of the paper is to present qualitative and quantitative dependence
of solid particle diameter, solid particle density, solid concentration, and Reynolds
number for carrier liquid phase on the ‘particles-wall’ shear stress. It is demonstrated
that the solid particle diameter plays crucial role in its dependence on the ‘particleswall’
shear stress. It was proved that in particular flow conditions the ‘particles-wall’
shear stress is much higher compared to the carrier liquid wall shear stress.},

The current HDD practice of calculating annular frictional pressure loss caused by drilling fluid drag based on the assumption of concentric annular flow of a Bingham plastic fluid is demonstrated to be overly conservative. Consequently, critical design parameters, such as depth of cover, which affects crossing length, and drilling equipment size, which is selected based on anticipated pulling load, cannot be optimized. This can result in overly conservative design and unnecessary construction costs. Parameter values currently employed in HDD pulling load prediction are challenged suggesting that the viscous shear of drilling fluid is significantly less than typically quoted and that the friction coefficients often employed are not representative of all skin friction effects in HDD. A new real-time monitoring cell for large-scale HDD is described that can be used to optimize installations and to assess and update current prediction models.},

The final form of the mathematical model constitutes a set of three non-linear partial differential equations.

The paper presents results of numerical simulation of the frictional head loss and friction factor for slurry flows with low, moderate, and high yield stresses. Predicted frictional head losses have been compared with experimental data showing satisfying agreement. It is demonstrated that the frictional head loss and the friction factor substantially depend on the yield stress. The results of numerical simulation are presented as figures and conclusions.

Substantial recent advancements have been made by numerous workers, applying the Herschel-Bulkley model to drilling fluids, highlighting the underlying importance of fluid rheology. However, this classic model alone does not fully describe the complexity of oilfield fluids. Therefore, this paper presents a Generalized Herschel-Bulkley (GHB) rheological model and hydraulic analytical method that accommodate a broader spectrum of wellbore fluids, whether of simple character, or having the complex properties of multiphase fluids such as foamed cement and high-density cements in addition to drilling fluids.The GHB model offers several advantages: (1) it readily reduces to several popular conventional models (Newtonian, power-law, Bingham-plastic, Casson, and Herschel-Bulkley), (2) it can provide additional flexibility for characterizing apparent viscosity functions of current and future multiphase fluid systems such as lightweight cements, foams, and high-density slurries, and (3) it can provide an effective generalized framework for developing friction prediction equations. A highly accurate numerical simulator for the comprehensive family of fluids modeled by the GHB model was developed for predicting laminar flow-friction loss in pipes and annuli. The computational method, based on several exact integrals of motion, could be made as accurate as desired by decreasing mesh size. While the simulator itself is not ideal for real-time application, the results of comprehensive calculations using it were incorporated into field-usable software by developing "generalized explicit functions" that encapsulated all the physics correctly. These practical functions are in turn used for accurately and rapidly predicting friction loss of the GHB family of fluids in pipes and annuli (concentric and eccentric) for laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow.IntroductionConventional rheological models in widespread use for the past half-century in the oil industry include the Bingham-plastic, power-law, and Newtonian models. Of these, the Bingham-plastic is advantageous because it includes a yield point that is a positive shear stress at zero shear rate, which most drilling fluids, cement slurries, and spacers have. The power-law model (pseudoplastic) is especially useful for fluids containing noncrosslinked water-soluble polymers. Both of these can reduce to the Newtonian model, which can be accurately used in those cases where water, brine, or simple oils are used in wellbore fluid applications. More recently, the Herschel-Bulkley model has seen increased usage because it accommodates the existence of a yield point (Bingham-plastic) as well as the nonlinearity of the shear-stress to shear-rate relationship (power-law).Field Operation ChallengesThis paper examines field conditions where past rheological correlations become inaccurate. There are several reasons why cement job simulations predict much higher or lower surface pressures than those found on the actual job. These reasons include, but are not limited to the following:Casing centralizationNarrow annuliDeviated wellboresInaccurate prediction of low-end (low pump-rate) rheology valuesOf these four conditions, the industry has good control on mechanical factors, casing centralization, and hole size. It is known that improving the centralization and widening the annulus not only improves the cement placement success rate, but also brings predicted and actual pumping pressures into better agreement.},

For the monodisperse systems, 35 different combinations of the Reynolds number Re (up to Re ¼ 1,000) and packing fraction f were studied, whereas for the bidisperse systems we also varied the diameter ratio (from 1:1.5 to 1:4) and composition, which brings the total number of different systems that we considered to 150. For monodisperse systems, the data was found to be markedly different from the Ergun equation and consistent with a correlation, based on similar type of simulations up to Re ¼ 120. For bidisperse systems, it was found that the correction of the monodisperse drag force for bidispersity, which was derived for the limit Re ¼ 0, also applies for higher-Reynolds numbers. On the basis of the data, a new drag law is suggested for general polydisperse systems, which is on average within 10\% of the simulation data for Reynolds numbers up to 1,000, and diameter ratios up to 1:4.},

It was found that the bentonite dispersions exhibit a time-dependent non-Newtonian behavior. In addition to the major factors affecting the rheological properties in the dispersion were the shearing value and duration, the rest time preceding the measurements and the structural state of the dispersion. The Herschel–Bulkley model was found to correlate well with the behavior of bentonite suspensions. The time evolution of the shear stress at constant shear rates was correlated by the Bird–Leider equation. In order to take into account structural evolution of the suspensions, the rheological law was modified by the introduction of the phenomenological model of Tiu and Boger derived from Moore’s kinetics evolution. It was observed that at short rest times and low shearing conditions, this model describes satisfactorily the time-dependent behavior of the bentonite suspensions. The behavior laws and kinetics evolution were established through the determination of structure destructuration and reorganization rates values. The structure parameters were found to be dependent on the clay concentration, providing evidence that the scale characteristic times of the buildup and breakdown processes are also concentration dependent.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents a theoretical and numerical study of the problem of turbulence
in non-Newtonian fluids. The dynamics of these systems can be modeled
in terms of transported active fields and constitutes a subject of general interest
in the physics of complex fluids. Their peculiar rheological properties make them
attractive also for engineering applications.
The major part of the work concerns the problem of turbulence in dilute polymer
solutions, i. e. viscoelastic fluids. Two issues are considered: the small-scale
statistics at moderate values of elasticity in a regime of fully developed turbulence;
the destabilization of a laminar flow by means of purely elastic nonlinearities.
The effect of polymer addition on small-scale turbulence has been investigated
within a simplified viscoelastic fluid model, in a homogeneous isotropic configuration.
The modifications induced on the turbulent cascade have been addressed,
and their consequences on small-scale statistics, such as acceleration, have been
examined.
In the opposite limit of negligible inertial nonlinearities, polymeric degrees of
freedom can destabilize a flow, provided the elasticity of the solution is sufficiently
large. At growing elasticity, a transition to chaotic, and finally turbulent,
states is observed. The basic experimental phenomenology has been numerically
reproduced for a two-dimensional flow, and the statistical properties have been
characterized.
Another item considered is that of binary mixtures. Phase separation between two
fluids has been investigated, studying the phase ordering process in the presence
of an externally forced velocity field. The competition between thermodynamic
segregation forces and local shears has been examined in both active and passive
mixtures. Finally, the marginal role of Lagrangian chaos in the phenomenon of
coarsening arrest has been highlighted.},

  abstract = {In a drilling operation hole cleaning plays an important role. Improper hole cleaning can lead to problems like reduced penetration rate, torque and drag increase, and increase in pipe sticking potential. Cutting transport in a wellbore is a complex problem affected by several parameters such as mud density, cutting size and density, rate of penetration and mud circulation rate. Researchers conducted experiments with different setups representing annulus flow in a limited number of hole sizes to investigate the contribution of several physical and operating conditions. Due to time and cost involved in the construction and conduction of the experiments all reported studies are limited to physical model dimensions and operating parameters. In this study, we introduced a new approach to determine the parameters affecting cutting transport in any wellbore. This method utilizes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software program. The effectiveness of selected program was determined by simulating successfully results from an experiment reported in literature. Presented in this study are the effects of cutting and mud properties on the cutting transport efficiency for vertical and horizontal wellbores. This approach eliminates the need for expensive laboratory setups and can be used to study unlimited number of physical and operational conditions in any wellbore.},

  abstract = {The problem of solid cleanout in horizontal wellbores is studied experimentally. The special case of drilling fluid circulation with no inner pipe rotation is considered. This case is similar to Coiled tubing drilling where often hole cleanout must be performed. Sand sized cuttings (ranging from 260 micron to 1240 micron) are used. Critical velocity and wall shear stress required for initiating bed erosion are measured. Water and viscous polymer base fluids with 3 different polymer concentrations are used. Results have shown that water always initiate cuttings movement at lower flow rates than polymer solutions. Fluids with higher polymer concentration and hence with higher viscosity required higher flow rates to start eroding the bed. Critical wall shear stress is also determined from pressure loss measurements. Analyzing the data revealed that water initiate cuttings removal at lower pressure loss than more viscous fluids. Higher viscosity fluids always showed higher pressure loss at the initiation of bed erosion. For the range of cuttings size studied, results show that intermediate cuttings size is easier to remove. Smallest and largest cuttings are more difficult to move requiring higher flow rates and higher pressure losses. Dimensionless analysis of relevant parameters to the process of cuttings movement is performed. It is shown that dimensionless wall shear stress (in the forms of Shield's stress and also ratio of shear velocity to settling velocity) correlates well with particles Reynolds number. Based on this finding two correlations are developed to predict wall shear stress required for initiating cuttings movement under different conditions.},

  abstract = {Turbulent flow of a Non-Newtonian polymeric fluid through concentric annuli is studied using a 9 m long horizontal flow loop (radius ratio = 0.4). The measurement technique used is Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The solvent Reynolds number is found to vary from 47000 to 66400. Pressure drops are measured and used to detect the onset of transition to turbulence. Measured velocity profiles are found to agree with the universal law of the wall for y + $<$ 11. In the logarithmic region, however, velocity profiles deviate from log law, in a manner consistent with the flow of Newtonian fluids. Reynolds stress is found to be reduced significantly compared to water. The polymer is found to contribute significantly to the total stress close to the solid walls. The radii of maximum velocity are found to be biased toward the inner wall. Results of the turbulence intensity analysis show a slight increase of axial intensities in the buffer layer and especially around the outer wall of the annuli for polymer solutions. Radial velocity fluctuations are suppressed by means of polymer solution. The Root Mean Square (RMS) of vorticity fluctuation in the axial direction is also analyzed revealing a significant reduction of vortical activities as polymer is added to the flow.},

Calculations predict that downhole temperature is very flow regime dependent, and flow regime depends on eccentricity of the inner string, which therefore is important to take into account. It is also demonstrated that the presence of tool joints may influence temperature dramatically.

material modeling. It introduces a terminology so that the material class ‘yield stress fluid’ is defined and can be distinguished
from the terms ‘solid’ and ‘liquid’. This new material classification is based on two criteria, the equilibrium relation and the
flow function. In line with this terminology, an experimental procedure for classifying the material behavior is presented. The
second key aspect of this paper is a discussion on the proper definition of the term ‘viscosity’. The benefit of the differential
viscosity over the dynamic viscosity in case of non-Newtonian fluids in general is worked out. This is shown by the most elementary
yield stress fluid, the friction element, because it is the basis of the yield stress concept. Its constitutive equations are
given for positive as well as negative strain rates and are also able to represent the preyield behavior. The theory presented
in this article is also applied to the Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt, and Bingham element to demonstrate the working principle.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider hyperbolic systems with relaxation in which the relaxation time \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$ may vary from values of order one to very small values. When \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$ is very small, the relaxation term becomes very strong and highly stiff, and underresolved numerical schemes may produce spurious results. In such cases it is important to have schemes that work uniformly with respect to \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$. IMplicit-EXplicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta (R-K) schemes have been widely used for the time evolution of hyperbolic partial differential equations but the schemes existing in literature do not exhibit uniform accuracy with respect to the relaxation time. We develop new IMEX R-K schemes for hyperbolic systems with relaxation that present better uniform accuracy than the ones existing in the literature and in particular produce good behavior with high order accuracy in the asymptotic limit, i.e., when \$$\backslash$varepsilon\$ is very small. These schemes are obtained by imposing new additional order conditions to guarantee better accuracy over a wide range of the relaxation time. We propose the construction of new third-order IMEX R-K schemes of type CK [S. Boscarino, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 45 (2008), pp. 1600–1621]. In several test problems, these schemes, with a fixed spatial discretization, exhibit for all range of the relaxation time an almost uniform third-order accuracy.},

Interesting convergence results of these errors and of the remainder of the expansion allow us to determine sharp error bounds for stiff problems. As a representative example of stiff problems we have chosen the van der Pol equation. We illustrate that the theoretical prediction is confirmed by the numerical test. Specifically, an order reduction phenomenon is observed when the problem becomes increasingly stiff. In particular, making several assumptions, we try to improve global error estimates of several IMEX Runge–Kutta methods existing in the literature.},

  doi = {10.2118/71375-MS},
  abstract = {Spacer and wash fluids play an essential role in the cementing of oil and gas wells. They are pumped ahead of the cement to optimize the mud displacement, enable a proper hole cleaning, and obtain a good cement bond at the formation and the casing surfaces. The design of spacer fluids relies on an ensemble of physical and chemical characteristics of the spacer including flow characteristics (rheological properties), the stability of the weighted spacer suspension, and the compatibility with other wellbore fluids. The flow characteristics of spacer fluids are the key to successful cementing. The wellbore fluids pumped in the field usually behave as viscoplastic fluids. The non-Newtonian nature of these fluids must be accurately modeled when determining the flow behavior around a centered or eccentric annulus to accurately determine flow regime and dynamic pressures in the annulus along the entire column of fluid. Turbulent flow is the preferred flow regime for efficient mud removal in the annulus, provided the cleaning fluid is effectively in turbulent flow all around the eccentered annulus. Therefore, a reliable criterion for the critical Reynolds number is needed to properly design the well-cleaning process and determine whether it is feasible to be in turbulent flow. In an effort to better understand the fluid dynamics involved with mud cleaning, we have conducted an experimental study on a series of spacer and model fluids. Axial velocity and relative fluctuation intensity measurements were conducted using three different techniques: (1) ultrasonic Doppler technique, (2) hot film anemometry, and (3) laser Doppler Doppler velocimetry. On the basis of these results, we have been able to fully characterize the laminar-to-turbulent transition and evaluate the pressure drop caused by highly non-Newtonian fluid. The results of this study help us define more reliable estimates of the minimum pump rate that will lead to substantial well-cleaning efficiency, taking into account the rheological behavior of non-Newtonian fluids.

  abstract = {The 'law of the wall' for the inner part of a turbulent shear flow over a solid surface is one of the cornerstones of fluid dynamics, and one of the very few pieces of turbulence theory whose results include a simple analytic function for the mean velocity distribution, the logarithmic law. Various aspects of the law have recently been questioned, and this paper is a summary of the present position. Although the law of the wall for velocity has apparently been confirmed by experiment well outside its original range, the law of the wall for temperature seems to apply only to very simple flows. Since the two laws are derived by closely analogous arguments this throws suspicion on the law of the wall for velocity. Analysis of simulation data, for all the Reynolds stresses including the shear stress, shows that law-of-the-wall scaling fails spectacularly in the viscous wall region, even when the logarithmic law is relatively well behaved. Virtually all turbulence models are calibrated to reproduce the law of the wall in simple flows, and we discuss whether, in practice or in principle, their range of validity is larger than that of the law of the wall itself: the present answer is that it is not; so that when the law of the wall (or the mixing-length formula) fails , current Reynolds-averaged turbulence models are likely to fail too.},

  shorttitle = {Creep-{{Recovery Test}}},
  abstract = {The relaxation time of drilling fluids is small compared to operational time, so under normal steady shear, the
viscous response is dominant. However, under infinitesimal deformation or high shearing speed, drilling fluids
behave viscoelastically. Viscoelasticity has received much attention from the petroleum industry since many
phenomena are related to it. Viscoelastic properties of fluid are the measurement of the gel structure, structure
stability and gelling speed. Hence, it governs particle settling and the invasion of fluid into the formation. These
viscoelastic properties can be determined through dynamic tests including oscillatory, creep-recovery and relaxation
tests. However, current rheological characterization is not sufficient to evaluate these important properties. In
addition, a standard test procedure for dynamic test is not available. Therefore, the petroleum industry still lacks a
rheological tool to evaluate fluids in term of particle transportation and structure stability.
In this search, creep-recovery test is used to obtain the viscoelastic properties of drilling fluids. A standard
experimental procedure is designed to obtain creep-recovery data of sixteen drilling fluids. This test procedure
provides a guideline for other experimental investigations. Creep compliance, a material function of fluid, is
analyzed and compared. A method of using creep-recovery data to evaluate the settling of particles is discussed. The
procedure to obtain the zero shear viscosity from creep-recovery test is shown in detail. To mathematically model
the viscoelastic response of fluids, a viscoelastic model, consisting of three Kelvin-Voigt models and one Maxwell
model, was used to fit the experimental data. The model parameters for each sample obtained from nonlinear
regression are presented.
The results of this study provide petroleum engineers a practical rheological tool to obtain zero shear viscosity,
predict particle settling and evaluate fluid structure stability. Our mathematical model can also be used to model the
viscoelastic response of drilling and hydraulic fracturing fluids.

Flow of three different fluids (aqueous carboxymethylcellulose solutions and kaolin and bentonite suspensions) was investigated in open channels of four different cross sections (rectangular, semicircular, trapezoidal, and triangular) at slopes varying from 1 to 5°. The new laminar model gave a closer fit to the data than those from the previously published models. However, the presence of the yield stress still presents a problem that makes flow prediction in laminar flow for such fluids not very accurate. The newmodel for turbulent flow gave the best fit to the flow data compared with the five previously published models, which fell within a 30\% error margin.A particular advantage of both new models is that they are applicable for all the different fluids tested and the four open channel cross-sectional shapes.},

  abstract = {Drilling fluids are time-dependent and exhibit viscoelastic behaviour; i.e., they exhibit both viscous and elastic responses under deformation. Viscoelastic properties of drilling fluids are very important to evaluate gel structure, gel strength, barite sag, hydraulic modelling, and solid suspension. However, elastic properties are still not being properly accounted for in rheological characterization. This study seeks to investigate quantitatively the viscoelastic properties of oil-based drilling fluids and the application of viscoelastic data in drilling operations. Standard test procedures were designed to measure viscoelastic properties of fifteen oil-based drilling fluids within the linear viscoelastic range. Experiments were performed using an Anton Paar Physica MCR 301 Rheometer. Periodic oscillatory tests were conducted to investigate material functions of fluids, evaluate gel strength, and time and temperature dependence. In oscillatory testing, amplitude sweep tests were used for determining the linear viscoelastic range, and detecting structural stability, gel strength and dynamic yield point. Frequency sweep tests were conducted to obtain storage modulus, loss modulus, complex viscosity and loss tangent. Temperature sweep tests were conducted in the temperature range from 4 to 80oC to obtain the temperature dependence on the internal gel structure of samples. Oscillatory time sweep tests were used to investigate the change and the stability of the structure of the drilling fluids as a function of time and temperature. The gelling time and gelling speed are calculated from time sweep tests. Experimental results are analyzed to evaluate the viscoelasticity of the samples. The results show that the tested fluids exhibit viscoelastic properties and the viscoelasticity of the samples strongly depends on temperature and gelling time. Further, the Cox-Merz rule, an empirical relationship between dynamic and steady-state viscosities, is very useful to estimate steady-state viscosity from complex viscosity and vice versa. It provides valuable information in the structure build-up during steady shear flow. However, data analysis confirms that the tested samples do not obey the Cox-Merz rule. The departure from the Cox-Merz rule of the tested samples is an indication of structural heterogeneities and weak structure build-up; this can be attributed to fluid structure decay. The extended Cox-Merz rule is proposed to correlate steady-state and dynamic viscosities. The Time-Temperature Superposition Principle was validated to be inapplicable for tested drilling fluids. Frequency sweep data (storage modulus and loss modulus) at different temperatures are not superimposed when shifted to a reference temperature. The results of this study provide quantitative information about the dynamic properties of drilling fluids. These give useful insight into the structure, stability, and time and temperature dependence of drilling fluids. The data can be used to evaluate static barite sag, cuttings transport and suspension, and hydraulic modelling and optimization.},

for a complex fluid in different flow situations are analyzed and compared with yield stress predictions

  abstract = {A mechanistic model for drilled cuttings transport in highly inclined wells is proposed. The model is base don the critical deposition velocity concept used in the pipeline slurry transport. The Oroskar and Turian expression, a mechanistic model for slurry transport in pipes, is extended to the problem of cuttings transport in the eccentric annuli of inclined oil wells. The model allows the computation of the critical flow rate and the cuttings bed height under various conditions of hole angle and size, drilling fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) and drilling rate. Predicted critical flow rates and bed heights, as a function of inclination angle, rate of penetration and mud rheology are compared to experimental data from two different large scale flow loops (5-inch and 8-inch outer diameters). The results indicate that the proposed model is a viable technique, although it requires further development and modification to include the effects of cuttings hold up and of distribution of turbulent eddy sizes in the annulus.},

Volume filtered equations for the carrier phase are derived in detail for variable density flows, and all unclosed terms are discussed. Special care is given to the interphase coupling terms that arise, in order to ensure that they are implemented consistently and that they converge under mesh refinement. This provides the flexibility of using cell sizes that are smaller than the particle diameter if necessary. Particle collisions are handled using a soft-sphere model that has been modified for parallel efficiency.

  abstract = {Computations of liquid–solid slurries in horizontal pipes are performed to investigate the complex multiphase flow dynamics associated with operating conditions above and below the critical deposition velocity. A high-fidelity large eddy simulation framework is combined with a Lagrangian particle tracking solver to account for polydispersed settling particles in a fully developed turbulent flow. The two phases are fully coupled via volume fraction and momentum exchange terms, and a two-step filtering process is employed to alleviate any dependence of the liquid-phase mesh size on the particle diameter, enabling the capture of a wide range of spatial turbulent scales. A fully conservative immersed boundary method is employed to account for the pipe geometry on a uniform Cartesian mesh. Two cases are simulated, each with a pipe geometry and particle size distribution matching an experimental study from Roco \& Balakrishnam, which considers a mean volumetric solid concentration of 8.4\%, corresponding to just over 16 million particles. The first case considers a Reynolds number based on the bulk flow of the liquid of 85,000, resulting in a heterogeneous suspension of particles throughout the pipe cross-section. Statistics on the concentration and velocity of the particle phase for this case show excellent agreement with experimental results. The second case considers a lower Reynolds number of 42,660, leading to the formation of a stationary bed of particles. Three distinct regions are identified in the second case, corresponding to a rigid bed at the bottom of the pipe, a highly-collisional shear flow just above the bed, and a dilute suspension of particles far from the bed. Computational results indicate segregation in particle size along the vertical direction, with the smallest particles located at the top, increasing monotonically until the bed surface, where the largest particles are located. The covariance of concentration and velocity of each phase is presented, giving further insight on the multiphase dynamics. Statistics on the individual mechanisms that contribute to the motion of each particle, namely forces due to drag, the pressure gradient and viscous stresses of the surrounding fluid, and collisions, are provided for each case. It is observed that for the majority of the pipe cross-section, the drag force dominates for each case, which is balanced by inter-particle collisions in the streamwise direction, and by gravity in the vertical direction. Simulation results are also used to investigate closures from Reynolds average modeling of multiphase flows.},

  abstract = {An experimental study of cuttings transport with foam at intermediate angles has been conducted in a full-scale Low Pressure-Ambient Temperature (LPAT) flow loop at The University of Tulsa. An anionic surfactant was used in these water base foam tests at a concentration of 1\% v/v. Air was used as dispersed fluid. Rheological tests were conducted to obtain flow curves for foams with 70\% and 80\% qualities in 2", 3" and 4" pipes. A simulator was developed to predict pressure, flow velocity, specific volume expansion ratio and foam quality along the wellbore based on the volume equalized power law model.Tests were conducted to determine the effects of inclination angle, foam quality, foam velocity and rate of penetration on cuttings transport. Results from this study show that the in situ cuttings concentration ranged, according to the inclination angles, from 4.8\% to 14.6\% for 45 degrees, 14.3\% to 22.3\% for 55 degrees and 8.5\% to 25.7\% for 65 degrees. It is shown in this study that the transport of cuttings (in terms of cuttings concentration) has a better performance with foams of low quality. For a given inclination angle and similar foam flow conditions, increasing the rate of penetration from 20 ft/hr to 44 ft/hr can lead to an increase in the in situ cuttings concentration of up to 7\%.A new correlation for the ratio of the cuttings bed area to the cross sectional area of the annulus as a function of dimensionless numbers (Ar, Re, Fr, Ss and ?) was developed and allows for pontential practical applicaitons. The differences between the calculated and measured values are within a range of ±17\%.IntroductionFoam has a variety of applications in the oil and gas industry. Particularly, foam can be used as a lightweight drilling fluid in under balanced drilling applications. Drilling with foam has been shown to provide significant benefits including increased drilling rate, minimization of lost circulation, reduction of differential pipe sticking and reduced formation damage. Foam also has potential applications in deepwater drilling operations.The rheological behavior of foams plays a key role in determining the efficiency of cuttings transport in drilling operations. Although great efforts have been made1-10 to model the rheology of foams, there is an apparent disagreement among investigators in selecting the best model for describing the flow behavior of foam. Due to the complexity of foams, the resulting models frequently contained parameters that are difficult or impossible to measure and hence of limited applicability.Valko et al.11 introduced the "Volume Equalized Principle" based upon the concept of constant friction factor (Reynolds Number) along the flow line. In practice, the principle states that all shear stress-shear rate data points obtained from isothermal experiments under different geometries and qualities (due to different volumetric inlet gas/liquid ratios or quality changes along a pipe) lie on a single curve if both the shear stresses and shear rates are volume equalized. Under this concept, the volume equalized rheological models are written as below:Power Law Volume Equalized:Equation 1Bingham Plastic Volume Equalized:Equation 2Hershel-Bulckley Volume Equalized:Equation 3Saintpere et al.12 reported that the Herschel Bulkley number can be a good indicator of carrying capacity. They suggested that the dimensionless parameter "characteristic time" provided an estimate of the necessary circulating time for hole cleaning. They also observed the worst hole cleaning efficiency at angles between 40° to 60°.Martins et al.13,14 conducted experimental and modeling studies to predict cuttings transport performance in horizontal and inclined wells. Results show that an increase in total flow rate helps bed erosion and higher liquid flow rates always result in better hole cleaning.},

  shorttitle = {{{SPE}}-178862-{{MS}}},
  abstract = {Inadequate hole cleaning during a drilling operation may result in immediate problems such as excessive torque or pack-off situations, or it can lead to delayed problems such as while running in hole with a casing/liner or a completion string in a leftover cuttings bed. It is therefore desirable to provide quantitative information about hole cleaning conditions: at the planning stage, while drilling or when investigating incidents.

Because the ability to transport cuttings particles varies with their position in the borehole and the current drilling parameters, hole cleaning modelling is a history-dependent problem. The precise modelling of the movement of solid particles during a drilling operation gives the possibility to estimate whether they are in suspension in the drilling fluid, settling on the low side or being eroded from a cuttings bed. These estimations may be confirmed through the change of the active volume or by the increase of downhole pressure, when PWD (Pressure While Drilling) measurements are available.

A transient cuttings transport model has been used for planning and monitoring an ERD (Extended Reach Drilling) well drilled in the North Sea. The model has been used to compare the expected performance of different mud systems on both hydraulic and mechanical limits that could be expected prior to drilling. For another challenging drilling operation, the model has been used to post analyze the sequence of actions that led to problems while running in hole with a liner. Here also, the observations tended to confirm the predictions made by the hole cleaning model.

Furthermore, an active use of such an advanced hole cleaning model may help determine the time required for circulation procedures prior to pull out of hole. This can help reduce the flat time associated with circulation procedures and at the same time decrease the duration by which the hole stays open thus reducing the risk of hole instability.},

  title = {Automation of Mud-Pump Management Application to Drilling Operations in the North-Sea},
  volume = {26},
  abstract = {Drilling in the North Sea is confronted with an ever more challenging pressure-management issue because of narrow geopressure windows in depleted reservoirs. Further, the occurrence of packoffs can cause serious damage to the formation and contribute to nonproductive time. To address these problems, automation of mud-pump management has been developed over the last 4 years to minimize the chance of fracturing the formation while starting the mud pumps or circulating. To account for abnormal flow restrictions in the annulus, automatic actions are also an integral part of the mud-pump automation described in this paper.

Since the downhole conditions are continuously changing (e.g., depth, temperature, flow-rate, gel time, cuttings proportion), the necessary safeguards to operate the mud pumps need to be updated constantly. Advanced transient temperature and hydraulic models are used to estimate, in real-time, the downhole situation. On the basis of the current context, evaluations of maximum pump rates and acceptable flow accelerations are performed and sent to the mud-pump control system to be used as an envelope of protection. Furthermore, to assist the driller during connections, the pump-startup procedure has been semiautomated to decrease connection time. Finally, an automatically triggered pump-shutdown procedure is also available to minimize the consequences of a packoff on formation fracturing.

A first version of the system has been tested during the drilling of one well in 2008 in the North Sea. Based on the initial experience, a revised version has been used during the drilling of three wells drilled on the Norwegian continental shelf in 2009. The feedback from the drillers involved in the testing has been used to improve the user friendliness of the system. The automation of the mud-pump management has been well accepted by the drilling crews. However, the testing has shown that additional instrumentation at the rigsite is necessary before such automation can be rolled out safely.},

  volume = {26},
  url = {https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-128286-PA},
  abstract = {Unrecognized axial and rotational movement of the drillstring can cause formation fracturing or fluid influx, resulting in costly remedial actions. With increasingly complex wellbore geometries and narrow geopressure windows, it is not always obvious for the driller how to estimate accurately the real maneuvering limits of the drawworks and the topdrive, especially under poor downhole conditions. The solution presented in this paper uses continuously updated safeguards applied to the drilling-control system to maintain a downhole pressure within the acceptable limits of the openhole formations. It automatically stops the movement of the drillstring in the case of abnormal hookloads or surface torques. Because automatic actions can be triggered in the case of an unexpected situation, some standard procedures have been fully automated, including friction tests and back reaming.

Numerical models are used to constantly calculate the maximum accelerations and velocities, which can be applied to the drillstring in the current drilling conditions. The resulting envelope of protection is dependent on many factors. Therefore, a proper evaluation of the downhole conditions is of paramount importance for the quality of the calculated safeguards. An automatic calibration of the physical models, on the basis of surface measurements, is at the heart of the system. The calibrated mechanical models are used to determine the limits for abnormal surface torques or hookloads. It is, therefore, possible to take actions automatically in the case of overpull, set-down weight, or high torque.

In 2008, a preliminary version of the system was tested during the drilling of a well in the North Sea. Even though the control algorithms did work well at that time, it was noticed that, in some circumstances, the drilling-control system would not be ready in time for fast-changing drilling conditions. An improved version of the drawworks and topdrive automation system has been tested during the drilling of three North Sea wells in the spring of 2009. In this last version, the response time of the system has been optimal at all times. The drillers involved in the testing of the system have found the system useful and user friendly.},

  url = {https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-163440-MS},
  abstract = {Current top-side and downhole instrumentation at the well site has been developed for the purpose of manually conducted drilling operations. The emergence of automatic drilling analysis software shows the limitations of today's measurements capabilities. It is therefore time to analyze the requirements for onsite instrumentation in order to implement new, efficient drilling automation technologies.

On one hand, drilling is facing more and more difficult conditions with narrow geo-pressure windows, deep water or high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions. On the other hand, unconventional hydrocarbon reserves may require a considerable amount of wells to be profitable. Drilling automation, by means of smart safeguards, automatic safety triggers, managed pressure drilling (MPD) and ultimately complete or semi-autonomous drilling rigs can provide the solution to safely construct wells in these challenging settings.

The common denominator for the vast majority of drilling automation solutions is the use of physical models of the drilling process in the form of heat transfer, mechanical and hydraulic models. By analyzing the requirements of those models for necessary boundary conditions, it is possible to derive which measurements should be made both at surface and downhole in order to obtain stable and accurate calculations. This analysis also provides a way to estimate the necessary accuracy of the boundary conditions to ensure reaching the target control tolerance.

Using the boundary condition analysis, it is possible to derive precisely which measurements should be done and where they should be performed. As a result, a typical organization of sensors that is compatible with the implementation of drilling automation solutions is derived.},

  abstract = {During a drilling operation, real-time analysis of surface and downhole measurements can give indications of poor hole cleaning. However, it is not always intuitive to understand how and where the cuttings are settling in the borehole, because the transportation of cuttings and the formation of cuttings beds are largely influenced by the series of actions performed during the operation. Using a transient cuttings transport model, it is possible to get a continuously updated prognosis of the distribution of cuttings in suspension and in beds along the annulus. This information can be of prime importance for taking decisions to deal with and prevent poor hole cleaning conditions.

A transient cuttings transport model has been obtained by integrating closure laws for cuttings transport into a transient drilling model that accounts for both fluid transport and drill-string mechanics.

This paper presents how this model was used to monitor two different drilling operations in the North Sea: one using conventional drilling and one using MPD (Managed Pressure Drilling). Some unknown parameters within the model (e.g. the size of the cuttings particles) were calibrated in order to obtain a better match with the top side measurements (cuttings flow-rate, active pit reduction due to cuttings removal). Using the calibrated model, the prediction of cuttings bed locations were confirmed by actual drilling incidents like pack-offs and overpulls while tripping out of hole.

Based on the calibrated transient cuttings transport model, it is thereby possible to evaluate what adjustments of the drilling parameters are necessary to stop and possibly remove the cuttings beds, therefore giving the drilling team the opportunity to take remedial and preventive actions based on quantitative evaluations, rather than solely upon the intuition and experience of the decision makers.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of a drilling operation is to a great extent governed by how well one is able to optimize the rate of penetration (ROP) throughout each stage of the operation. ROP optimization normally involves balancing drilling speed on the one hand with acceptable wear to the drill bit on the other. The bit lifetime is largely determined by the mechanical conditions at the bit-formation rock interface and the weight on bit (WOB) and torque on bit (TOB) provide important information related to the working condition of the bit. The accuracy of WOB and TOB measurements can thus become a determining factor for the overall drilling efficiency.

Due to the low bandwidth of downhole mud pulse-based telemetry systems, the WOB and the TOB are generally derived from surface measurements, i.e. from the hook load and the top-drive torque. Field experience indicates that a WOB derived from surface measurements can be of limited accuracy, such as when surface measurements suggest a negative WOB even though the ROP is positive, or when high sampling rate and high precision downhole measurements confirm a large discrepancy between the memory recorded downhole data and the estimated values based on the measurements made at the level of the hoisting equipment and the top-drive.

The reason for these inconsistencies is simply that there are numerous physical processes taking place between the bit and the surface measurements that are normally not accounted for when WOB and TOB are estimated. This paper reviews and analyses the sources of these deviations and models the physical processes in order to quantify the precision for which the WOB and the TOB can be ascertained using solely surface measurements. Methods are also proposed that compensate for certain side effects by utilizing real-time torque and drag and hydraulic calculations.},

  title = {An Overview of Flow Regimes Describing Slurry Transport},
  abstract = {In dredging, the hydraulic transport of solids is one of the most important processes. Since the 50's many researchers have tried to create a physical mathematical model in order to predict the head losses in slurry transport. We can think of the models of Durand, Condolios, Gibert, Worster, Zandi \& Govatos, Jufin Lopatin, Fuhrboter, Newitt, Doron, Wilson, Matousek and Turian \& Yuan. Some models are based on phenomenological relations and thus result in semi empirical relations, others tried to create models based on physics, like the two and three layer models. It is however the question whether slurry transport can be modeled this way at all. Observations in our laboratory show a process which is often non-stationary with respect to time and space. Different physics occur depending on the line speed, particle diameter, concentration and pipe diameter. These physics are often named flow regimes; fixed bed, shearing bed, sliding bed, heterogeneous transport and (pseudo) homogeneous transport. It is also possible that more regimes occur at the same time, like, a fixed bed in the bottom layer with heterogeneous transport in the top layer. It is the observation of the authors that researchers often focus on a detail and sub-optimize their model, which results in a model that can only be applied for the parameters used for their experiments. At high line speeds the volumetric spatial concentration (volume based) and the volumetric transport concentration (volume flux based) are almost equal, because all the particles are in suspension with a small slip related to the carrier fluid velocity. The difference of the head loss between the two concentrations will be within the margin of the scatter of the experiments. At low line speeds however, there may be a sliding or fixed bed, resulting in a big difference between the two concentrations and thus between laboratory and real life situations. This paper describes 9 flow regimes and 6 possible scenarios. The flow regimes for constant C vs are; 1: fixed bed without suspension, 2: fixed bed with suspension, 3: sliding bed with suspension, 5: heterogeneous, 6: (pseudo) homogeneous, 7: homogeneous and 8: sheet flow. The flow regimes for constant C vt are; 4: sliding bed with suspension, 2: fixed bed with suspension, , 5: heterogeneous, 6: (pseudo) homogeneous, 7: homogeneous and 8: sheet flow. 3 scenarios are based on a constant volumetric spatial concentration (usually in a laboratory) and 3 scenarios are based on a constant volumetric transport concentration (usually in real life). The flow regimes and scenarios are explained and examples of experiments are given. Based on the experimental evidence, one can conclude that the approach followed in this paper gives a good resemblance with the reality.},

  doi = {10.1098/rspa.1973.0038},
  abstract = {Owing to observational difficulties the distinction between a ‘suspended’ load of solids transported by a stream and a ‘ bed-load ’ has long remained undefined. Recently, however, certain critical experiments have thrown much light on the nature of bed-load transport. In particular, it has been shown that bed-load transport, by saltation, occurs in the absence of fluid turbulence and must therefore be due to a separate dynamic process from that of transport in suspension by the internal eddy motion of a turbulent fluid. It has been further shown that the forward motion of saltating solids is opposed by a frictional force of the same order as the immersed weight of the solids, the friction coefficient approximating to that given by the angle of slip. The maintenance of steady motion therefore requires a predictable rate of energy dissipation by the transporting fluid. The fluid thrust necessary to maintain the motion is shown to be exerted by virtue of a mean slip velocity which is predictable in the same way as, and approxim ates to, the terminal fall velocity of the solid. The mean thrust, and therefore the transport rate of saltating solids, are therefore predictable in terms of the fluid velocity close to the bed, at a distance from it, within the saltation zone, of a ‘centre of fluid thrust’ analogous to the ‘centre of pressure’. This velocity, which is not directly measurable in water streams, can be got from a knowledge of stream depth and mean flow velocity. Thus a basic energy equation is obtained relating the rate of transporting work done to available fluid transporting power. This is shown to be applicable to the transport both of wind-blown sand, and of water-driven solids of all sizes and larger than that of medium sand. Though the mean flow velocity is itself unpredictable, the total stream power, which is the product of this quantity times the bed shear stress, is readily measurable. But since the mean flow velocity is an increasing function of flow depth, the transport of solids expressed in terms of total stream power must decrease with increasing flow depth/grain size ratio. This considerable variation with flow depth has not been previously recognised. It explains the gross inconsistencies found in the existing experimental data. The theoretical variation is shown to approximate very closely to that found in recent critical experiments in which transport rates were measured at different constant flow depths. The theory, which is largely confirmed by these and other earlier experiments, indicates that suspension by fluid turbulence of mineral solids larger than those of medium sands does not become appreciable until the bed shear stress is increased to a value exceeding 12 times its threshold value for the bed material considered. This range of unsuspended transport decreases rapidly, however, as the grain size is reduced till, at a certain critical size, suspension should occur at the threshold of bed movement.},

  title = {High-Temperature, High-Pressure Rheology of Water-Based Muds},
  doi = {10.2118/18035-MS},
  abstract = {This paper reports measurements of the rheology of a range of water-based drilling muds at temperatures up to 130 deg. C and pressures up to 1000 bar. The fluids are highly thixotropic; pressures up to 1000 bar. The fluids are highly thixotropic; decoupling of temperature/pressure effects from those due to time-dependent structural changes was achieved by developing a sample preparation and handling procedure which ensures that all samples experience identical shear histories prior to study in the rheometer. This enabled essentially equilibrium flow curves to be determined over a shear rate range of 0 - 1200 s-1 with a reproducibility of better than +/-1 Pa in stress.

The data were best fitted using a three parameter Herschel-Bulkley yield/power-law model although in many cases, particularly at low temperatures and high pressures, the two particularly at low temperatures and high pressures, the two parameter Casson equation gave an acceptable fit for parameter Casson equation gave an acceptable fit for engineering purposes. For both models the behaviour of the highshear viscosity reflected the viscous behaviour of the continuous phase: a weak pressure dependence and an exponential temperature dependence matching that of water. The pressure dependence increased with mud density. In all cases the pressure dependence increased with mud density. In all cases the fluid yield stress was essentially independent of pressure. In contrast to oil-based muds, where this quantity decreases with temperature, for these water-based systems it remained constant below some characteristic temperature, whereafter it increased exponentially with inverse temperature.

The physical origins of the observed behaviour are discussed and a simple model for representing the data is given. It is shown how this may be used for reliable extrapolation of surface measurements to downhole conditions for well-circulated water-based muds.},

  abstract = {Experiments were made in a flume 15-3 18 in. wide by 12 ft long to

boundary layer. Determinations were made for two sediments, a quartz
sand with geometric mean sieve size of 0. 102 mm and glass beads with
geometric mean sedimentation diameter of 0. 037 mm.
The intensity of sediment motion was judged from the frequency of
bursts of motion over a small area varying from 7 to 18 mm in diameter.
When the burst frequency fell between 113 and 1 burst per second, critical
conditions for inception of motion were considered to obtain.
Values of shear velocity, u*, and bed shear stress, 7 for turbulent

flow were determined from measured velocity profile data by essentially two
methods. In the first the slope, N, of a straight line fitted to a semilogarithmic
graph of velocity profile data was used in Eq. (8) to obtain u:::.
In the other, values of point velocity, u, at a distance of .03 ft from the
bed was substituted into the logarithmic equation for velocity distribution
at a smooth wall, Eq. (5), to obtain u,\$. The data obtained from Eq. (8)
and plotted on Fig. 14a show wider scatter than those calculated from
Eq. (5) and plotted on Fig. 14b. The data obtained by means of Eq. (5) are
considered the more reliable and are presented on a complete Shields

  abstract = {Within a granular material stress is transmitted by forces exerted at points of mutual contact between particles. When the particles are close together and deformation of the assembly is slow, contacts are sustained for long times, and these forces consist of normal reactions and the associated tangential forces due to friction. When the particles are widely spaced and deformation is rapid, on the other hand, contacts are brief and may be regarded as collisions, during which momentum is transferred. While constitutive relations are available which model both these situations, in many cases the average contact times lie between the two extremes. The purpose of the present work is to propose constitutive relations and boundary conditions for this intermediate case and to solve the corresponding equations of motion for plane shear of a cohesionless granular material between infinite horizontal plates. It is shown that, in general, not all the material between the plates participates in shearing, and the solutions for the shearing material are coupled to a yield condition for the non-shearing material to give a complete solution of the problem.},

  title = {Study of Cuttings Transport Using Water-Based and Oil-Based Drilling Fluids},
  abstract = {Cuttings transport is a topic of great interest in the oil and gas drilling industry. Insufficient cuttings transport leads to several expensive problems. Knowledge and selection of the drilling fluids is one of the important factor for efficient hole cleaning. The present work reports pure hydraulic and cutting transport behavior of various oil-based and water-based drilling fluids. Flow loop experiments were conducted on a purpose built flow loop close to realistic field conditions.
It has been observed, however, that the hole cleaning performance of drilling fluids can be different even if the fluid rheological properties are similar as measured in accordance with API specifications. The reasons for stated difference in the behavior of drilling fluids are not well understood. The objective of the present work was to compare hole cleaning performance of an oil-based drilling fluid and a water-based drilling fluid with similar density and viscosity measured as per API specifications. Also, to identify the reasons for differences in their hole cleaning behaviour. Limited studies are available in the literature which studied the same and conclusions differ.
Hole cleaning efficiency of an oil-based drilling fluid and a water-based drilling fluid whose viscosity profiles are similar was investigated. The fluids tested were industrial fluids used in the field and were sent to us after reconditioning. Experimental studies were performed on an advanced purpose-built flow-loop by varying flow velocities and drill string rotation rates. The flow loop had a 10 m long annulus section with 4" inner diameter wellbore and 2" outer diameter fully eccentric drill string. Pressure drop and sand holdup measurements were reported. Rheological investigations of the same fluids were used to understand the difference in the behavior of the drilling fluids tested. In case of no drill string rotation, better hole cleaning performance was observed with the oil-based fluid compared to the water-based fluid. With the presence of drill string rotation, hole cleaning performance of both the fluids was nearly the same.},

  title = {An {{Eulerian}}-{{Lagrangian CFD}} Study of a Particle Settling in an Orthogonal {{GNF}} Shear Flow},
  volume = {In Review},
  abstract = {For the purpose of improving CFD models of particle transport in wellbore flows, i.e. cuttings transport, we have extended the Lagrangian Discrete-Particle-Model model of the commercial code ANSYS Fluent 17.2 to describe the motion of a particle settling in a shear-thinning, mildly viscoelastic orthogonal shear flow. Essentially, the fluid strain rate as the magnitude of the fluid deformation rate tensor is corrected by a particle-induced shear rate. This corrected strain rate is used to compute an apparent viscosity. The fluid is treated as a Generalized Newtonian Fluid using Cross and Carreau material functions. Different drag laws are investigated, including one which accounts for the fluids viscoelastic wake structure behavior via a correction term. We validate the model with eight different particle trajectories representing different combinations of particle diameters, fluid flow rates and rheological properties (water and polymeric solutions) provided by Khatibi et al (2016) [1].
In general, the experimental trajectories are satisfactorily replicated by the CFD model. However, for small particles a trajectory mismatch is observed close to the lower channel wall. We find this mismatch to be a consequence of unexpectedly high particle x-velocities in the experimental data. Various possible causes are identified and discussed. More detailed experimental near-wall data of both particle and fluid velocities as well as more sophisticated modeling of the fluids rheology, including the rheology effect on the forces acting on the particles, may be required to minimize the mismatch.
In addition, we further conclude that in case of the polymeric solutions particle drag is the dominant particle force, that the viscoelastic wake of the particle is not significantly affecting the trajectories and that a Newtonian drag law may be used as long as the particle-induced shear rate is estimated with ‖v\_r ‖/d\_p and a material function accounting for the limiting zero-shear Newtonian viscosity is applied.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent pipe flow of a Generalised Newtonian (GN) fluid at Re τ = 323 are analysed to identify the region where GN rheology has the major influence. The flow domain is divided into two parts: in y + $<$ y + up and y + $>$ y + up , with the viscosity modelled using a power-law rheology for y + $<$ y + up and a uniform viscosity for y + $>$ y + up. Values for y + up of 35 and 70 are considered. Results show that beyond y + = 70, the GN rheology has no significant effect on the mean flow or turbulence statistics, and that the effect of GN rheology is confined to the near wall. To understand these results , the turbulent kinetic energy budget of the GN fluid and a Newtonian fluid at the same Re τ = 323 are compared. The comparison shows that the GN viscosity-dependent terms in the balance either vanish or do not show rheology dependence beyond y + = 70. The current results imply that in Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes and Large eddy simulations the GN rheology's effects can be taken care of by modifying the wall functions.},

The relation between gas pressure gradient and the flow rates of the two phases is predicted, over the whole range of cocurrent and countercurrent flows, together with velocity profiles for both phases and the radial concentration profile for the particles. The gas and the particles interact through a drag force depending on their relative velocity, and there are mutual interactions between pairs of particles through inelastic collisions.

  abstract = {Abstract Stimulated reservoir volume fracturing, in unconventional gas and tight oil development, is a key technology. Injecting low viscosity sand-laden fluid of high flow rate, it can form complex fracture networks. Therefore, placement of proppant deep into the complex fracture networks brings a conductive path for production enhancement and reduces flowing resistance when fluid flowing form rock matrix to wellbore. At current, it is still unclear that sand features of low viscosity sand-laden fluid of high flow rate, and especially for proppant transport in subsidiary fractures are also not clearly understand. In this study, we fully think about the practical condition of engineering. Thus, in terms of similarity criterion of geometry and Reynolds number, we build a large scale of proppant placement in visualization complex fracture networks device which can changes angles of fractures, width of fractures and numbers of fractures. Due to the single factors experiment, this paper will discuss a series tests to evaluate proppants transport in complex fracture networks. Different slick water treatment tests are simulated by pumping sand slurry through the visualization complex fracture networks device while varying parameters of perforation, angles of fractures, proppant size, pump rate and proppant concentration. From the experiment, treatment tests which are used in variable factors can obtain different laws about traction carpet feature, traction carpet areas, balance hight and balance time in complex fracture networks. This paper also describes a 3-D physical model. This model is designed by SolidWorks software and using grid software to make complex fracture grids. Afterwards, using fluent software to simulate proppant concentration distribution field in the model of complex fracture networks. In addition, comparing the results between physical model and numerical model, the results can reveal, during the process of SRV, the law of proppant placement in complex fracture networks and serve as guidelines for engineering design.},

Model parameters, such as annulus-friction factor, cuttings-deposition rate, and re-entrainment rate, were determined from numerous experiments previously performed by use of a large-scale cuttings-transport flow-loop apparatus. This apparatus simulates the complex flows in borehole annuli at various inclination angles, ranging from vertical to horizontal. In this study, the authors validate the model and analyze the cuttings transport by use of field data in a directional well, in which the annular ECD was measured by logging while drilling (LWD), and the rate of the returned cuttings was measured at the surface. On the basis of the simulation study, the potential of the developed transient-cuttings-transport simulator for the predrilling-and post-drilling-phase analyses is discussed. Moreover, the authors evaluate the transient-hole-cleaning conditions and the ECD behavior from the LWD data.},

The extended model reproduces satisfactorily new experimental data as well as data of previous investigators. The additional effect of the gravitational force induces higher pressure gradients together with higher limit deposit velocity as the pipe's upward tilt is increased. For downwards inclination, the limit deposit velocity decreases drastically, and the pressure drop is reduced, since for downflow gravitation acts as a driving force},

  abstract = {Based on the notion of a construction process consisting of the stepwise addition of particles to the pure fluid, a discrete model for the apparent viscosity as well as for the maximum packing fraction of polydisperse suspensions of spherical, non-colloidal particles is derived. The model connects the approaches by Bruggeman and Farris and is valid for large size ratios of consecutive particle classes during the construction process, appearing to be the first model consistently describing polydisperse volume fractions and maximum packing fraction within a single approach. In that context, the consistent inclusion of the maximum packing fraction into effective medium models is discussed. Furthermore, new generalized forms of the well-known Quemada and Krieger-Dougherty equations allowing for the choice of a second-order Taylor coefficient for the volume fraction (phi2-coefficient), found by asymptotic matching, are proposed. The model for the maximum packing fraction as well as the complete viscosity model are compared to experimental data from the literature showing good agreement. As a result, the new model is shown to replace the empirical Sudduth model for large diameter ratios. The extension of the model to the case of small size ratios is left for future work.},

  abstract = {Friction pressure estimation is an important part of pipe and annular hydraulics useful for determining hydraulic horsepower requirements and the maximum wellhead pressure. For non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow, the friction factor can be calculated with the Hagen–Poiseuille type equation. In turbulent flow, however, several correlations have been developed for smooth pipes. Many of these correlations are in the form of the Dodge–Metzner equation for flow in smooth pipes. The Dodge–Metzner correlation was developed using carbopol aqueous solution which is not used for oilfield operations. Previous studies on friction factor correlation comparison have been limited to the use of non-Newtonian fluid friction factor equations for smooth pipes neglecting the significant effect of pipe roughness on wellbore hydraulics. Generally, tubulars in oilfield applications have some degree of roughness which results in higher friction pressure than that for smooth pipes of the same size especially for less viscous fluids. A few studies have addressed the effect of roughness on friction pressure loss. In this study, friction factor correlations with relative roughness are compared with experimental measured friction factor data using a statistical approach as the basis for comparison. Further, equivalent diameter definitions for annular flow are evaluated to determine the friction factor–equivalent diameter combination that best describes the experimental data. The objective of this work is to recommend the non-Newtonian friction factor correlation that allows for accurate prediction of frictional pressure losses in rough pipes and annular sections.},

  abstract = {A cylindrical pipe facility with a length of 32 m and a diameter of 40 mm has been designed. The natural transition Reynolds number, i.e. the Reynolds number at which transition occurs as a result of non-forced, natural disturbances, is approximately 60 000. In this facility we have studied the stability of cylindrical pipe flow to imposed disturbances. The disturbance consists of periodic suction and injection of fluid from a slit over the whole circumference in the pipe wall. The injection and suction are equal in magnitude and each distributed over half the circumference so that the disturbance is divergence free. The amplitude and frequency can be varied over a wide range. First, we consider a Newtonian fluid, water in our case. From the observations we compute the critical disturbance velocity, which is the smallest disturbance at a given Reynolds number for which transition occurs. For large wavenumbers, i.e. large frequencies, the dimensionless critical disturbance velocity scales according to Re−1, while for small wavenumbers, i.e. small frequencies, it scales as Re−2/3. The latter is in agreement with weak nonlinear stability theory. For Reynolds numbers above 30 000 multiple transition points are found which means that increasing the disturbance velocity at constant dimensionless wavenumber leads to the following course of events. First, the flow changes from laminar to turbulent at the critical disturbance velocity; subsequently at a higher value of the disturbance it returns back to laminar and at still larger disturbance velocities the flow again becomes turbulent. Secondly, we have carried out stability measurements for (non-Newtonian) dilute polymer solutions. The results show that the polymers reduce in general the natural transition Reynolds number. The cause of this reduction remains unclear, but a possible explanation may be related to a destabilizing effect of the elasticity on the developing boundary layers in the entry region of the flow. At the same time the polymers have a stabilizing effect with respect to the forced disturbances, namely the critical disturbance velocity for the polymer solutions is larger than for water. The stabilization is stronger for fresh polymer solutions and it is also larger when the polymers adopt a more extended conformation. A delay in transition has been only found for extended fresh polymers where delay means an increase of the critical Reynolds number, i.e. the number below which the flow remains laminar at any imposed disturbance.},

  title = {Transport of {{Small Cuttings}} in {{Extended}}-{{Reach Drilling}}},
  volume = {23},
  doi = {10.2118/104192-PA},
  abstract = {Field experience has shown that inefficient transport of small cuttings is a main factor for excessive drag and torque during extended-reach drilling; however, very little is known about the transport behavior of small cuttings. In this study, extensive experiments with three sizes of cuttings (0.45 to 3.3 mm) were conducted in a field-scale flow loop (8 in.×4.5 in., 100-ft long) to identify the main factors affecting small cuttings transport. The effects of cuttings size, drillpipe rotation, fluid rheology, flow rate, and hole inclination were investigated. The results show significant differences in cuttings transport based on cuttings size. Smaller cuttings result in a higher cuttings concentration than larger cuttings in a horizontal annulus when tested with water. However, a lower concentration was achieved for smaller cuttings when 0.25-ppb polyanionic cellulose (PAC) solutions were used. Unlike the transport of large cuttings, which is mainly dominated by fluid flow rate, the key factors controlling small cuttings transport were found to be pipe rotation and fluid rheology. Improvement by pipe rotation in the transport efficiency of small cuttings is up to twice as large as the improvement in large cuttings transport. Compared with water, PAC solutions significantly improve smaller cuttings transport, while the transport of larger cuttings is only slightly enhanced. Mathematical modeling was performed to develop correlations for cuttings concentration and bed height in an annulus for field applications. Predictions from a three-layer model previously developed for larger cuttings were also compared with experimental results. Differences (up to 80\%) indicate the need for improving the frequently used three-layer model by including correlations specifically developed for small cuttings to get a better design of extended-reach drilling. This study is also useful for horizontal or high-angle well drilling and completion through sand reservoirs. Introduction Efficient cuttings transport is a major challenge when a long extended-reach well with a horizontal and highly inclined section of more than 20 thousand feet is drilled (Guild et al. 1995; Gao and Young 1995; Schamp et al. 2006). Cuttings can be ground to finer sand while being transported out of the hole, especially when rotary drilling is used. Drilling may not be able to proceed if cuttings transport remains a problem in such a hole. Because of excessive drag and torque caused by small cuttings settled at the lower side of the horizontal or inclined section, it may not be possible to run casing in place even if drilling to the target depth can be achieved. Similar problems exist in horizontal and highly inclined wells drilled through unconsolidated sand reservoirs. Field practice and experimental observations (Parker 1987; Larsen 1990; Gavignet and Sobey 1989; Ahmed 2001; Bassal 1995) show that smaller cuttings are more difficult to transport under certain conditions. Moreover, smaller particles tend to more easily stick a drillpipe because of their cohesive effects (Ahmed 2001; Gailani et al. 2001). It is even more difficult to release the pipe once it is stuck by small, sand-sized cuttings. An investigation into previous studies in the area of hole cleaning and sand transport shows that very limited information is available for small cuttings transport under drilling conditions. Though different cuttings have been tested by several investigators (Parker 1987; Larsen 1990; Ahmed 2001; Bassal 1995; Ford et al. 1990; Peden et al. 1990; Martins et al. 1996), no study has been conducted on small cuttings transport in horizontal or high-angle annuli involving drillpipe rotation. Previous conclusions about the cuttings size effects on cuttings transport are quite diverse, and even contradictory in some cases (Parker 1987; Larsen 1990; Gavignet and Sobey 1989; Ahmed 2001; Ford et al. 1990; Peden et al. 1990; Martins et al. 1996). Their experiments, upon which these conclusions are based, were conducted under incomparable conditions. It may not be correct, or at least not safe, to state explicitly that smaller cuttings are harder or easier to transport. The result may depend on various combinations of drilling parameters. This study was undertaken to understand why and under what conditions they are harder or easier to transport.},

In this study, the Dynamic Testing Facility (DTF) was modified to study the effects of drill pipe rotation on foam flow. Experiments were conducted for aqueous and polymeric foams with qualities ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 under different flow rates. Foam rheology were also tested using the pipe viscometer on the DTF and compared with rheology measurements using the FGV and the ACTF, respectively. Results show that pipe rotation increases pressure drop for lower quality foams (below 70\%), but slightly decreases pressure drop for higher quality foams (above 80\%). Calibration results of two nuclear densitometers are presented. Preliminary CFD simulations with pipe rotation in both concentric and eccentric annuli are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although rotary drilling is being used in most wells, the impact of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning during foam drilling has not been investigated. There has been no single predictive tool developed to address pipe rotation effects on foam drilling. This paper presents the first study of cuttings transport using foam with pipe rotation under simulated downhole conditions. A field-scale, high-pressure/high-temperature wellbore simulator with a 73-ft-long, 5.76 x 3.5-in. eccentric annular test section was used to investigate the effects of pipe rotation, foam quality and velocity, downhole pressure and temperature on cuttings transport, and pressure losses in a horizontal wellbore. Experiments were conducted with backpressures from 100 to 400 psi and temperatures from 80 to 160°F. Pipe rotary speeds were varied from 0 to 120 RPM, with foam qualities ranging from 60 to 90\% and foam velocities from 2 to 5 ft/sec. It was found that pipe rotation not only significantly decreases cuttings concentration in a horizontal annulus but also results in a considerable reduction in frictional pressure loss. The reduction in cuttings concentration is up to 40\% at a medium foam velocity (3 ft/sec) when pipe is rotated up to 120 RPM. The decrease in frictional pressure loss is up to 50\% at a medium foam velocity and is more than 60\% at a low velocity. Using a higher foam velocity or quality also improves hole cleaning; however, pressure losses are significantly increased. A mechanistic model and an associated computer simulator were developed for practical design and field applications. It can be used to predict cuttings concentration, bed height, and pressure drop during horizontal foam drilling with various pipe rotary speeds, eccentricities, foam qualities, and velocities under different pressure and temperature conditions. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental results show that the difference is less than 15\% in most of the cases.},

  abstract = {Effective removal of small, sand-sized solids is critical for successful drilling and completion operations in sand reservoirs. Recent experience in extended-reach drilling also indicates that inefficient transport of smaller cuttings is a main factor for excessive drag and torque. This study was undertaken to determine two critical conditions for efficient transport of small solids. The two conditions are represented by the critical resuspension velocity (CRV), the minimum fluid velocity necessary to initiate solids-bed erosion, and the critical deposition velocity (CDV), the minimum fluid velocity required to prevent bed formation. Experiments were conducted in a field-scale flow loop (8 × 4.5 in., 100 ft long) to determine CRV and CDV for 0.45-mm and 1.4-mm sands in different fluids over a range of bed heights and hole inclinations. The results show that, depending on sand size and fluid properties, CDV is approximately two to three times larger than CRV. Water is more effective than low-concentration polymer solutions for bed erosion. However, polymer solutions are more helpful than water in preventing bed formation. This indicates the need for different drilling fluids for cleanout and drilling operations. A mechanistic model was developed to predict CRV for a solids bed. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate the importance of interparticle forces that are incorporated into the model. The model accounts for drillpipe eccentricity in any direction in an annulus, which is consistent with experimental observations. The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental results. Existing CDV correlations developed for larger cuttings were verified by experimental data for sands. The differences are approximately 25\%. Results in this study will be useful not only in drilling and completion through sand reservoirs, but also in extended-reach drilling and sand control.},

  abstract = {Research in robust control theory has been one of the most active areas of mainstream systems theory since the late 70s. This research activity has been at the confluence of dynamical systems theory, functional analysis, matrix analysis, numerical methods, complexity theory, and engineering applications. The discipline has involved interactions between diverse research groups including pure mathematicians, applied mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers. This research effort has produced a rather extensive set of approaches using a wide variety of mathematical techniques, and applications of robust control theory are spreading to areas as diverse as control of fluids, power networks, and the investigation of feddback mechanisms in biology. During the 90's the theory has seen major advances and achieved a new maturity, centered around the notion of convexity. The goal of this book is to give a graduate-level course on robust control theory that emphasizes these new developments, but at the same time conveys the main principles and ubiquitous tools at the heart of the subject. Its pedagogical objectives are to introduce a coherent and unified framework for studying robust control theory, to provide students with the control-theoretic background required to read and contribute to the research literature, and to present the main ideas and demonstrations of the major results of robust control theory. The book will be of value to mathematical researchers and computer scientists wishing to learn about robust control theory, graduate students planning to do research in the area, and engineering practitioners requiring advanced control techniques.},

  abstract = {Research results for a five year project on the development of improved modeling techniques for nonconventional (e.g., horizontal, deviated, multilateral or “smart”) wells are presented. The overall program entails the development of enhanced well modeling and general simulation capabilities. The development and features of a new general purpose research simulator (GPRS) are described. The simulator accommodates varying degrees of solution implicitness, handles structured and unstructured grids, and can additionally be used for modeling fractured reservoirs. Advanced linear solution techniques were also implemented. A general gridding and upscaling procedure for unstructured models is presented. The method includes a streamline simulation technique that can be used to assess the accuracy of the coarse model. A semianalytical technique for the modeling of nonconventional wells was developed. This model, implemented into an advanced well modeling software package (AdWell), provides an approximate treatment of reservoir heterogeneity and is able to model downhole inflow control devices and wellbore pressure losses. The well index, which is a key parameter in finite difference well models, can also be computed from AdWell. A drift-flux model for the description of multiphase wellbore flow is presented. Parameters applicable for use in practical systems are determined through tuning to unique experimental data (obtained outside of this DOE sponsored research) on large- diameter pipes. The optimum deployment of nonconventional wells is considered next. A genetic algorithm for determining the optimum well type and location is described. A technique for the optimization of smart well control is then presented. The linkage of the method with a history- matching procedure provides a prototype real-time well control strategy.},

The results establish qualitatively comparable results to prior experimental work. Therefore, the tool is made useful by isolating and studying the effects of changing parameters.

based on circle geometry. The result obtained showed that the theoretical results for bed
height and perimeter were approximately the same as that of the practical result. The

  abstract = {A great number of multiphase fluid systems within the areas of food, materials and chemistry
contain fibre-like components. Most of the "food fibres" originate from the organic raw
materials, which also compose the foodstuff (e.g. cellulose / polysaccharide fibres which can
be found in cereal, fruit and vegetable products). On the other hand it is conceivable to pro¬
duce specific fibre-like components (e.g. protein fibres) to be added to the fluid systems, in
order to alter the flow and the structuring properties in a defined way. In the domain of food¬
stuffs influencing these properties is important both for the process optimization and for the
development of products with stable non-demixing microstructures and structure-induced
sensorial texture and consistency characteristics. In the present work basic knowledge about
the orientation behaviour in sheared fibre suspensions was acquired and the influence of the
structuring mechanisms on the flow characteristics of the suspension was studied.
The image analysis, which was developed during this work, lays the foundation for the inves¬
tigation and the characterization of fibre orientation. Based on the Hough transformation, a
computer program was developed and implemented, in order to determine the orientation
angle of fibres in dilute suspensions. The source code of this program ("FindLines") was
written in the object-oriented programming language C++, with the use of the class library
MacApp. Apart from the actual transformation function the program contains all important
image processing algorithms and allows for a determination of the orientation angles even
when fibres are overlapping. In highly concentrated suspensions, rather than measuring the
orientation of each single fibre, an integral measure for the degree of fibre orientation was
defined. The necessary image processing steps are based upon the Fourier transform and
were implemented in the form of Matlab macro programs.
For the experimental investigations, special model apparatus were developed. In the parallel
band apparatus a uniaxial laminar shear flow can be induced, with a constant shear rate over
the shear gap. In particular, the orientation behaviour of a single model fibre was examined
in this apparatus. In agreement with calculations of Jeffery [25] and Bretherton [26], a peri¬
odical tilting motion of the fibre was observed in the shear flow. The portion of time the
observed fibres are aligned along the streamlines depends upon their aspect ratio (i.e. the
ratio of fibre length to fibre diameter). In a tube flow apparatus dilute and semi-dilute suspen¬
sions were studied. Starting from a random orientation, the structuring behaviour of the fibres
in the Poiseuille flow was investigated. For this purpose the mean orientation angle and the
standard deviation of the orientation angles of the fibres were determined. The higher the
fibre concentration was chosen, the stronger the fibre interactions were and the faster the
determined values approached an equilibrium value. In a parallel plate shear rheometer
experiments were carried out using highly concentrated suspensions of carbon fibres embed¬
ded in a polymer melt. Based on microtomic cutting of the solidified samples, the degree of
fibre orientation was measured by means of image analysis. Furthermore this shear apparatus
allowed for a measuring of the shear stress during the shearing. The obtained rheological data were compared to complementary measurements carried out in conventional rotational rheometers.
Concentrated fibre suspensions show rheodynamic and shear thinning flow characteristics.
The rheodynamic effects result from the orientation mechanisms of the fibres in the sheared
suspension, whereas the shear thinning is attributed to the pronounced influence of the par¬
ticle-particle interactions compared with the viscous flow forces at small shear rates. For ini¬
tially unorientated fibres the rheodynamic flow behaviour of a suspension can be
characterised by an rheopectic increase and a subsequent thixotropic decrease of viscosity.
The rheopexy can be explained by the multiple tilting motions of the fibres at the beginning
the shearing. These orientation movements lead to an increase of the particle-particle inter¬
actions and to a reinforcement of the fibre network. The subsequent thixotropic behaviour is
a consequence of the "destruction" of the fibre network, of the increasing orientation of the
fibres and of the resulting decrease of the mutual hindering of the particles.},

  title = {Laminar and Turbulent Flow Characteristics of Non-{{Newtonian}} Homogeneous Slurries},
  abstract = {In many situations, hydraulic transport is considered a competitive means of solids transportation because it can bring several advantages. Compared to a mechanical transport, the hydraulic transport is dust free, demands less labor, and enables full automation for operation. So, it may be one of the most economic and safe transport methods. To keep hydraulic transport economically attractive, it is required to transport slurries at high solids concentrations. Therefore it is required to have enough information on the flow behavior of dense slurries in pipelines. For homogeneous slurries, when increasing the solids content the mixture can behave as non- Newtonian fluids. The aim of this paper is experimentally investigate the flow characteristics of homogeneous slurries that showed non- Newtonian behavior. So, the experimental measurements of kaolin slurries in a pipeline test loop have been studied and compared with the theoretical predictive approaches. The slurry volumetric concentrations ranged from Cv = 2.8\% to 22.6\%. Both laminar and turbulent flow regime were obtained.},

  abstract = {Tests of a proposed friction-factor equation have shown it to be accurate for calculating pressure loss in turbulent flow for a pipeline transporting a non-Newtonian fluid, such as most crude oils and petroleum products. The accuracy of the proposed equation was checked statistically and by measured and field-calculated data. Turbulent pressure loss due to friction in any pipeline can be calculated only if the friction factor is first determined. Determining this factor poses a significant problem for a pipeline engineer designing for non-Newtonian fluids because of the large number of friction-factor equations available in the literature. The present research work set out to compare among the different friction-factor equations and propose an accurate one. The results led to proposal of a regression equation for calculating the friction factor based on the available measured data.},

  abstract = {One of the most important practical problems in non-Newtonian fluids flowing in pipes is the reliable prediction of the pressure drop accompanying the flow. For laminar flow, this problem is well established as the relation between the pressure drop and mean velocity can be derived by integration of the representative rheological model. However, the prediction of the pressure losses in the turbulent regime is still requiring more theoretical and practical analysis. The analysis in this paper has been focused on the observed phenomena that the turbulent flow behaviour appears unrelated to the laminar rheological characteristics and it could be found similar to Newtonian turbulent flow behaviour. The aim of study in this paper is to find a theoretical approach that could match the experimentally investigated turbulent flow behavior of non-Newtonian slurries flowing in pipes. The suggested approach is based on the similarity of non-Newtonian turbulent flow behaviour with that of Newtonian one. Dependence of turbulent flow behaviour on the laminar rheological characteristics and also will be discussed. So, the experimental measurements of kaolin slurries at different concentrations have been analyzed and compared with the suggested approach.},

  abstract = {An experimental study followed by comprehensive flow modeling is presented. The experiments were conducted on a horizontal well setup with drillstring under compression, considering the influence of rotation on frictional pressure losses of Yield Power Law (YPL) fluids. Flow through various buckling configurations with and without drillstring rotation was investigated. A new correlation is presented for the transition from laminar to turbulent regions in concentric and eccentric annuli. A broad model of flow of YPL fluids is proposed for concentric, eccentric and buckled configurations. The model includes the effects of rotation in laminar, transitional and turbulent flow. A 91 ft. inner pipe was rotated while applying axial compression during flow. At the no-compression case, eccentricity of the inner pipe is varied as the drillstring rotated. The aim for such a design was to simulate actual drilling operations. The test matrix involves flow through sinusoidal, transitional and helically-buckled drillstring. The effect of pitch length is investigated. Helical modes with two different pitch lengths were tested. Seven distinct YPL fluids were used to examine the dependence of pressure losses on fluid parameters. In the theoretical part, a stability criterion is modified to determine the onset of transitional flow in YPL fluids and a correlation is proposed for practical purposes. In addition, pressure loss prediction models are presented for the flow of YPL fluids through concentric, eccentric, free and buckled configurations of the drillstring, with and without rotation. The proposed models are compared with the literature and the experiments. It has been observed that increasing eccentricity and rotation causes an earlier transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Increasing eccentricity decreases pressure losses. In addition, the buckled configurations show a further decrease in frictional pressure losses as the compression increases. In the helical mode, decreasing the pitch length results in a decrease in pressure losses. Rotation tests with free drillstring show an increase in pressure losses as the rotary speed of the drillstring increases. Also, rotating the drillstring while it is compressed suggests an elevated increase in pressure losses due to amplified vigorous motion of the drillstring. Distinct differences in the effects of buckling and rotation are observed in laminar, transitional and turbulent flow. The greatest differences are found in the transition region. Flow of YPL fluids is one of the greatest challenges in the modern drilling industry. Studies that correspond to actual drilling conditions are substantially important in reducing these challenges. The information obtained from this study can be used to improve the control of bottomhole pressure during extended reach (ERD), horizontal, managed pressure (MPD), offshore and slim hole drilling applications. Consequently, this theoretical and experimental research has the potential to lead to safer, deeper and more precisely controlled oil/gas well drilling operations.},

Velocity profiles calculated for a Herschel-Bulkley fluid prove to be a very accurate representation of the measurements for laminar flow at reynolds numbers below about 1500. The measured profiles develop an unexplained asymmetry for higher Reynolds numbers until the flow undergoes transition to turbulence. The fluid is drag reducing under turbulent flow conditions with relative levels of tangential and radial turbulence intensity suppressed in comparison with water whilst the axial turbulence intensity is little different. Under all flow conditions it is evident that the fluid rheology is far from structural equilibrium, with values for the apparent yield stress and effective viscosity determined from near-wall velocity measurements considerably below those obtained from a rheometer.},

that the viscometric viscosity, loss and storage moduli for two of the most common polymers used for flow
experiments, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and xanthan gum (XG), are practically insensitive to the chemistry
of the tap water used as a solvent, to the method of mixing, and to the biocide added. However, the properties of
CMC from two different manufacturers were found to be significantly different, whereas there was no difference
between XG solutions prepared from different batches from the same manufacturer. Our conclusion is that for a
given concentration in water, the properties of certain non-Newtonian liquids, such as CMC and XG, are essentially
fixed and reproducible. Although the situation is less than ideal, comparisons of fluid-flow data from entirely independent
laboratories can thus be made even in the absence of direct rheological measurements.},

Each of the non-Newtonian fluids was shear thinning and to some extent elastic and one was also thixotropic in character. For comparison purposes, measurements are also reported for a Newtonian fluid. In the case of the Newtonian fluid, a mixture of glucose syrup and water, the f-Re data in both laminar and turbulent flow follow the appropriate relationships for the annular geometry, with a clear demarcation at transition which is confirmed independently by a measured increase in the centre-channel axial turbulence intensities. The measured velocity profiles for laminar flow are in good agreement with those predicted theoretically, whilst the turbulent profiles obey the log-law relationship over much of the mid-channel region and tend to the u + =y + relationship in the immediate vicinity of both walls. For the first non-Newtonian fluid, an aqueous solution of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), good agreement with theoretical predictions for a power-law fluid was observed in the f-Re data in the laminar regime with evidence of drag reduction in turbulent flow. Velocity profiles, determined in two planes, indicate minor circumferential asymmetry in laminar flow. Law-of-the-wall plots for fully turbulent flow indicate an upward shift in the data in the log-law region of the annulus consistent with the drag-reduction behaviour, as also observed in pipe-flow experiments for this fluid (Escudier et al. 1992). In the near-surface regions of both the outer and inner tubes the data again tend towards the u § =y§ relationship. Received:},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of cuttings transport for a two-region system composed of a fluid bed (omega-region) and a stationary bed of drill cuttings, which is considered as a porous medium (eta-region) in the two-phase system. The omega-region is made up of a solid phase (sigma-phase) dispersed in a continuos fluid phase (beta-phase), while the eta-region consists of a stationary solid phase (sigma-phase) and a fluid phase (beta-phase). The volume averaging method was applied in this study. Volume-averaged transport equations were derived for both the fluid bed and the porous medium regions. These equations are based on the non-local form of the volume-averaged momentum transport equation that is valid within the bounded region. Outside this region, the non-local form reduces to the classic volume-averaged transport equation. From these equations, a one-equation model was obtained, and the constraints that the one-equation model must satisfy were applied. For estimating the averaged pressure drop and the averaged velocity, the one-equation model was solved numerically by using the finite-difference technique in the implicit scheme. Numerical results are in agreement with experimental data and theoretical results reported in the literature.},

  doi = {10.1051/m2an:2005011},
  abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology for constructing accurate and efficient hybrid central-upwind (HCU) type schemes for the numerical resolution of a two-fluid model commonly used by the nuclear and petroleum industry. Particularly, we propose a method which does not make use of any information about the eigenstructure of the Jacobian matrix of the model. The two-fluid model possesses a highly nonlinear pressure law. From the mass conservation equations we develop an evolution equation which describes how pressure evolves in time. By applying a quasi-staggered Lax-Friedrichs type discretization for this pressure equation together with a Modified Lax-Friedrich type discretization of the convective terms, we obtain a central type scheme which allows to cope with the nonlinearity (nonlinear pressure waves) of the two-fluid model in a robust manner. Then, in order to obtain an accurate resolution of mass fronts, we employ a modification of the convective mass fluxes by hybridizing the central type mass flux components with upwind type components. This hybridization is based on a splitting of the mass fluxes into components corresponding to the pressure and volume fraction variables, recovering an accurate resolution of a contact discontinuity. In the numerical simulations, the resulting HCU scheme gives results comparable to an approximate Riemann solver while being superior in efficiency. Furthermore, the HCU scheme yields better robustness than other popular Riemann-free upwind schemes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we deal with the construction of hybrid flux-vector-splitting (FVS) schemes and flux-difference-splitting (FDS) schemes for a two-phase model for one-dimensional flow. The model consists of two mass conservation equations (one for each phase) and a common momentum equation. The complexity of this model, as far as numerical computation is concerned, is related to the fact that the flux cannot be expressed in terms of its conservative variables. This is the motivation for studying numerical schemes which are not based on (approximate) Riemann solvers and/or calculations of Jacobian matrix. This work concerns the extension of an FVS type scheme, a Van Leer type scheme, and an advection upstream splitting method (AUSM) type scheme to the current two-phase model. Our schemes are obtained through natural extensions of corresponding schemes studied by Y. Wada and M.-S. Liou (1997, SIAM J. Sci. Comput.18, 633–657) for Euler equations. We explore the various schemes for flow cases which involve both fast and slow transients. In particular, we demonstrate that the FVS scheme is able to capture fast-propagating acoustic waves in a monotone way, while it introduces an excessive numerical dissipation at volume fraction contact (steady and moving) discontinuities. On the other hand, the AUSM scheme gives accurate resolution of contact discontinuities but produces oscillatory approximations of acoustic waves. This motivates us to propose other hybrid FVS/FDS schemes obtained by removing numerical dissipation at contact discontinuities in the FVS and Van Leer schemes.},

  abstract = {We explore the relationship between two common two‐phase flow models, usually denoted as the two‐fluid and drift‐flux models. They differ in their mathematical description of momentum transfer between the phases. In this paper we provide a framework in which these two model formulations are unified. The drift‐flux model employs a mixture momentum equation and treats interphasic momentum exchange indirectly through the slip relation, which gives the relative velocity between the phases as a function of the flow parameters. This closure law is in general highly complex, which makes it difficult to analyze the model algebraically. To facilitate the analysis, we express the quasi‐linear formulation of the drift‐flux model as a function of three parameters: the derivatives of the slip with respect to the vector of unknown variables. The wave structure of this model is investigated using a perturbation technique. Then we rewrite the drift‐flux model with a general slip relation such that it is expressed in terms of the canonical two‐fluid form. That is, we replace the mixture momentum equation and the slip relation with equivalent evolution equations for the momentums of each phase. We obtain a mathematically equivalent formulation in terms of a two‐fluid model and by this bridge some of the gap between the drift‐flux model and the two‐fluid model. Finally, the effect of the various exchange terms on the wave structure of the two‐fluid model is investigated.},

The liquid is treated as an incompressible fluid whereas the gas is assumed to be polytropic. The model is rewritten in terms of Lagrangian coordinates and is studied in a free boundary setting where the liquid and gas masses are of compact support initially, and continuous at the boundary. Consequently, the initial masses involve a transition to single-phase gas flow and vacuum at the boundary. An appropriate balance between pressure and viscous forces is identified which allows obtaining pointwise upper and lower estimates of masses. These estimates rely on the assumption of a certain relation between the rate of degeneracy of the viscosity coefficient and the rate that determines how fast the initial masses are vanishing at the boundary. By combining these estimates with basic energy type of estimates, higher order regularity estimates are obtained. The existence of global weak solutions is then proved by showing compactness for a class of semi-discrete approximations.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to construct semi-implicit numerical schemes for a two-phase (two-fluid) flow model, allowing for violation of the CFL criterion for sonic waves while maintaining a high level of accuracy and stability on volume fraction waves.

By using an appropriate hybridization of a robust implicit flux and an upwind explicit flux, we obtain a class of first-order schemes, which we refer to as weakly implicit mixture flux (WIMF) methods. In particular, by using an advection upstream splitting method (AUSMD) type of upwind flux [S. Evje and T. Flåtten, J. Comput. Phys., 192 (2003), pp. 175--210], we obtain a scheme denoted as WIMF-AUSMD.

We present several numerical simulations, all of them indicating that the CFL-stability of the WIMF-AUSMD scheme is governed by the velocity of the volume fraction waves and not the rapid sonic waves. Comparisons with an explicit Roe scheme indicate that the scheme presented in this paper is highly efficient, robust, and accurate on slow transients. By exploiting the possibility to take much larger time steps, it outperforms the Roe scheme in the resolution of the volume fraction wave for the classical water faucet problem. On the other hand, it is more diffusive on pressure waves.

Although conservation of positivity for the masses is not proved, we demonstrate that a fix may be applied, making the scheme able to handle the transition to one-phase flow while maintaining a high level of accuracy on volume fraction fronts.},

Based on the Weakly Implixit Mixture Flux (WIMF) approach [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 26 (2005), pp. 1449–1484], we here develop an extension denoted as Strongly Implicit Mixture Flux (SIMF). Whereas the WIMF schemes are restricted by a weak CFL condition which relates time steps to the fluid velocity, the SIMF schemes are able to break the CFL conditions corresponding to both the sonic and advective velocities. The schemes possess some desirable features compared to current industrial pressure-based codes. They allow for sequential updating of the momentum and mass variables on a nonstaggered grid by solving two sparse linear systems. The schemes are conservative in all convective fluxes and consistency between the mass variables and pressure is formally maintained. Numerical experiments are presented to shed light on the inherent differences between the WIMF and SIMF families of schemes. In particular, we demonstrate that the WIMF scheme is able to give an exact resolution of a moving contact discontinuity. The SIMF schemes do not possess the “exact resolution” property of WIMF, however, the ability to take larger time steps can be exploited so that more efficient calculations can be made when accurate resolution of sharp fronts is not essential, e.g. to calculate steady state solutions.},

Our analysis is based on a simplified formulation of the model, structurally similar to the Euler equations. The main underlying building block is a pressure-based implicit central scheme. Explicit upwind fluxes are incorporated, in a manner ensuring that upwind-type resolution is recovered for a simple contact discontinuity.

  abstract = {Solid particles settling in drilling fluids has been one of the major problems in effective removal of drilled cuttings from the bit to the surface for a profitable drilling operation. The drag coefficient and particle Reynolds number has been reproduced experimentally and compared with theoretical work. The drag coefficient is influenced by particle size and shape, surface roughness, wall effects, turbulence intensity, fluid properties as expected. Experiments were conducted using two types of drilling fluids, water and HEC solution of which water represented Newtonian fluid and HEC solution represented Non -Newtonian fluid. The Experiment was conducted using a cylindrical column of 1m to observe the settling rates of these particles in both fluids. Electronic stop watch was used to record the settling rates of these particles. Four cuttings sizes were used in conducting the experiment ranging from 0.055 cm to 0.692 cm with densities ranging from 2.150 g/cm3 to 2.820 g/cm3. The Experiment was conducted at a room temperature of 25o C. The results showed lower Reynolds numbers which fall within the Laminar flow regime and could not produce higher Reynolds numbers to account for the turbulent flow regime due to experimental set up of 1m cylindrical column. The drag coefficient decreased with increasing particle Reynolds number. Lower particles gave higher drag coefficient and lower Reynolds numbers while higher particles gave lower drag coefficient and higher Reynolds numbers in comparison for both Newtonian and Non- Newtonian fluids. The settling velocity of a given particle decreases as the fluid becomes more viscous, therefore the settling rate curve for the viscous fluid shifts downwards as the fluid viscosity increases. Empirical correlations were developed and compared with theoretical and experimental work and it showed satisfactory agreement},

  abstract = {Abstract An understanding of flow along horizontal wells can be important for reservoir management, specially: Tight and shale reservoir. As the completed length in such wells is considerably larger than that in conventional vertical wells, the flow field inside the wellbore can have a significant impact on the overall production characteristics of an oil reservoir. Flow in a well-bore is different from conventional pipe flow due to the presence of wall inflow (as in production wells) or outflow (as in injection wells), and this affects the wall friction, acceleration, and flow patterns inside the pipe. To better understand wellbore flow, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation has been used. A significant advantage of such simulation, besides the fact that they could potentially replace actual experiments, is that they offer a large amount of information on the turbulent velocity and pressure fields, the K-epsilon turbulent model was used to identify the entrance lenth and serve petroleum engineers to locate Pwf inside the horizontal drain for IPR calculation. One of the applications of such information is the development of new techniques in the perforation technology and fracturation of shale and tight reservoir, based upon FLUENT (a commercial CFD software) simulations. Keywords Horizontal well, CFD, Turbulence, Pressure loss, Perforation, Performance, Drain, Completion, wellbore. Introduction: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be described as the use of numerical computing to produce information about the ways in which fluids flow in given situations. CFD techniques have been widely applied in the aerospace, automobile and defence sectors and numerous other industries where describing or simulating fluid flow fields and properties are important. In this report we consider the application of CFD for the description of flow in horizontal oil wells. A horizontal well consists of a long perforated pipe (linear) into which fluid enters through perforations in the wall. The pressure difference between the reservoir and the wellbore liner determines the local production rate.The pressure drop in the well liner is caused by a number of factors: -~ The acceleration pressure gradient due to wall inflow or outflow. -~ The pressure gradient due to inflow direction: Inflow may enhance the axial flow if the inflow angle is less than 90 degrees, whereas it may hinder the axial flow if the inflow angle is greater than 90 degrees. However, under practical flow conditions, the inflow directional effect is negligible. -~ The frictional pressure gradient. - The gravitational pressure gradient (for inclined wellbores). It has been observed that this pressure drop reduces the production as one move from the production end (heel) towards the closed end (toe) of the well. Consequently there is higher production in the heel region of the well as compared with the toe of the well. This can sometimes lead to extreme results, like more than half the production from the first quarter length of the well. Such phenomena reduce the productivity of the well, and hence the flow fields and parameters which affect production in a horizontal well need to be investigated and understood. In this context, the most commonly used models are two equation models called k - Epsilon models [8]. Such models have been extensively tested for industrial pipe flows and other practical applications. These models use the assumption of isotropic turbulent viscosity, even though this is not strictly consistent with the anisotropic nature of the turbulent structure of the flow field. Still, as far as prediction of global parameters like pressure drops is concerned, the two equation models have proven to be adequately robust. If the details of the flow field are desired, these models could still be used with some modifications, but one would then probably need to use the full Reynolds Stress models, albeit at a large increase in computational time.},

The Navier-Stokes equations coupled with an Oldroyd-B model are solved using a finite-element method with the EVSS formalism, and the particles are moved according to their equations of motion. In a vertical channel filled with a viscoelastic fluid, a particle settling very close to one side wall experiences a repulsion from the wall; a particle farther away from the wall is attracted toward it. Thus a settling particle will approach an eccentric equilibrium position, which depends on the Reynolds and Deborah numbers. Two particles settling one on top of the other attract and form a doublet if their initial separation is not too large. Two particles settling side by side approach each other and the doublet also rotates till the line of centers is aligned with the direction of sedimentation. The particle-particle interactions are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations, while the wall repulsion has not been documented in experiments. The driving force for lateral migrations is shown to correlate with the pressure distribution on the particle's surface. As a rule, viscoelasticity affects the motion of particles by modifying the pressure distribution on their surface. The direct contribution of viscoelastic normal stresses to the force and torque is not important. Keywords:},

  abstract = {How good are your models? Can they be used to improve your drilling processes? These are questions often posed in relation to real-time model applications, including models integrated with drilling control. Do the models fulfill requirements with regards to accuracy and calculation speed? Can the data be applied by the models to both interpret the state of the process and provide reliable input for calculations? Can the rig equipment be used safely and securely to control the processes? This paper seeks to answer these questions and further elaborate on current activities and near-term challenges in drilling automation. While static models are generally accepted, the use of dynamic models is emerging. In real-time model applications, it has been found that rig equipment analysis is necessary to assess applicability or upgrading requirements. Controlling machines for drilling operations using outputs from models has been successfully achieved. This paper provides examples of recent developments within drilling automation, drawing from applications of closed-loop control systems in the North Sea. Challenges regarding interpreting state-of-the-process are discussed, with respect to existing rig instrumentation, while examining the need for enhanced surface and downhole sensors. Mathematical models used with the drilling control system must communicate regularly with the drilling process to extract information from sensors and provide updated control commands for automation. How sensor data is applied through models to enable automation functionality is also illustrated. Introduction Instrumentation arrived fairly early in the drilling business, as drillers developed new ways to monitor the well drilling beneath them. Steam-pressure gauges were quickly followed by drilling-fluid pressure gauges. By the late 1920s, the weight indicator appeared, giving the driller the first look at the drillstring interaction with the wellbore. These early sensors were used in real time to monitor current conditions while drilling. With the advent of chart recorders, drilling trends could be more easily recognized. When computers were introduced to the industry, data could be recorded with more accuracy, and output could be displayed in real time or archived for post-well review. With data interchange protocols and satellite telecommunication systems, virtually all the parameters from surface and sub-surface sensors can be viewed in near real time around the globe. As monitoring gave way to trending, trending is now yielding the stage to dynamic modeling. The question is whether the nature of the sensors and the methods used for data processing kept pace with the way the data is used today. Real-time drilling process models have developed from simplified steady-state models incorporating the physics of single-phase fluid flow and static drillstring torque and hook load, used primarily for planning and decision-making purposes, to more advanced dynamic models having increasing complexity with regards to process details. Today's models address such drilling dynamics as drillstring mechanics and vibrations, temperature modeling and multiphase flow including high-accuracy multiple fluid and cuttings transport calculations. These dynamic drilling models in turn enable new types of model-enabled control functionalities such as advanced managed pressure drilling, dual-gradient applications, rate of penetration (ROP) optimization and automatic safeguarding of the drilling process with regards to well and rig limitations. The complexity of the model equations increases as more effects are taken into account, and the number and complexity of required sub-models and correlations are increasing to achieve the level of complexity required as the model results are linked closer and closer to control of the drilling procedure, from advisory to physical constraints and up to the point of automatic control of the drilling machinery.},

  abstract = {The subcharacteristic condition for hyperbolic relaxation systems states that wave velocities of an equilibrium system cannot exceed the corresponding wave velocities of its relaxation system. This condition is central to the stability of hyperbolic relaxation systems, and is expected to hold for most such models describing natural phenomena. In this paper, we study a hierarchy of two-phase ow models. We consider relaxation with respect to volume transfer, heat transfer and mass transfer. We formally verify that our relaxation processes are consistent with the rst and second laws of thermodynamics, and present analytical expressions for the wave velocities for each model in the hierarchy. Through an appropriate choice of variables, we prove directly by sums-of-squares that for all relaxation processes considered, the subcharacteristic condition holds for any thermodynamically stable equation of state.},

Define, from viscometer data, the rheological model (PowerLaw, Bingham Plastic, or Herschel-Bulkley) that best describes a particular drilling fluid.

Model the drilling fluid velocity profile in a defined annular geometry.

Predict the minimum circulation rate required to ensure efficient cuttings transport for a wide range of operational conditions.

The paper describes how the lift and drag forces on the cuttings have been determined and used in the development of the package. Case studies that demonstrate the functionality of the package are also presented.},

Prior analytical solutions for laminar flow are utilized. Turbulent flow solutions are developed using the Metzner–Reed Reynolds number after determining the local power law parameters as functions of flow geometry and the Herschel–Bulkley rheological parameters. The friction factor is estimated by modifying the pipe flow equation. Transitional flow is solved introducing transitional Reynolds numbers which are functions of the local power law index. Thus, an integrated, complete and consistent set, combining analytical, semi-analytical and empirical equations, is provided which describe fully the flow of Herschel–Bulkley fluids in concentric annuli, modelled as a slot. The comparison with experimental and simulator data from various sources shows very good agreement over the entire range of flow types.},

Depending on the sample tested, information on polymer degradation, solvent
evaporation, dispersion settling, cure information and/or time dependant thixotropy, can
be found. By determining the time for polymer degradation, solvent evaporation and
dispersion settling, information related to the maximum time of any analytical test can be
measured. Once any of these cases occur, the material properties change so drastically
that accurate and reproducible measurements becomes difficult.},

  abstract = {Viscosity regularisation methods are probably the most popular current method for computing visco-plastic fluid flows. They are however
generally used in an ad hoc manner. Here we examine convergence of regularised solutions to those of the corresponding exact models, in
both mathematical and physical senses. Mathematically, the aim is to give practical guidance as to the order of error that one might expect
for different regularisations and for different types of flow. Our theoretical results are illustrated with a number of computed example flows
showing the orders of error predicted. Physically, the question is whether or not the regularised solutions behave in the same way as the
exact solutions, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. We show that there are flows for which regularisation methods will generate their
maximum errors, e.g. lubrication-type flows. In this context, we also consider the effects of regularisation on problems of hydrodynamic
stability. For broad classes of problems, stability characteristics of the flow are incorrectly predicted by the use of viscosity regularisation
methods.},
