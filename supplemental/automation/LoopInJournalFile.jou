; http://www.eureka.im/797.html

; Users have expressed their desire to be able to automate runs by using journal files in which
; entire sections of many commands are repeating, in "loops".
; The simple Scheme function below allows the user to repeat a certain group of
; TUI Fluent journal commands groupped in a string for a specified number of times.
  
 
 
;;;
;; This is a Scheme functionality which
;; allow the user to repeat a text command
;; group of text user interface commands
;; for a specified number of times
;;
;; Usage
;; 1) Load the Scheme into Fluent session through
;; File>Read>Scheme or through (load "loop1.scm")
;; 2) Example of using the functionality:
;; (loop-command "/di/cont/press ,, /di/hc "im%n.tiff" /so/dti 5 20" 111)
;; This will repeat for 111 times the Fluent journal sequence
;; /di/cont/press ,,
;; /di/hc "im%n.tiff"
;; /so/dti 5 20
